<p id="letter1"><span>Sunday 3 March 2013</span> </p>
<b><span>Letter # 1</span></b>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>I read yesterday in the New York Times that the EIR for the 
Keystone XL pipeline presents no «&nbsp;environmental barrier&nbsp;» to 
the building of the pipeline. But that’s not a reason to build it.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/us/us-report-sees-no-environmental-bar-to-keystone-pipeline.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/us/us-report-sees-no-environmental-bar-to-keystone-pipeline.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>I urge you to take some advice from Charles W. Eliot, who, in 
1908, urged the Harvard graduating class to&nbsp;: «&nbsp;observe 
keenly, reason soundly, imagine vividly.&nbsp;»<span>&nbsp; </span>Observing keenly in our modern age means paying attention to the important data. </span></p>
<p><span>1. Tar sands oil produces more greenhouse gases than conventional oil.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Construction jobs are short-lived.</span></p>
<p><span>3. We need to very quickly start <u>de</u>-creasing our carbon emissions, or we will not pass on a robust and healthy planet to our children.</span></p>
<p><span>Please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is the right thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>Susan J. Ringler, Ph.D.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday I recommended the 1908 advice of Charles W. Eliot: «&nbsp;observe keenly, reason soundly, imagine vividly.&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span>When you reason soundly about what a </span><span>US</span><span> President can do in 8 years, it is clear that your moment is NOW. You can take the important step of <u>stopping </u>the
 Keystone XL pipeline and be remembered in history as a courageous 
leader, or you can allow the pipeline and be remembered as a president 
with lots of potential but disappointing follow-through.</span></p>
<p><span>The choice is yours. Please have the courage to follow your convictions and start this country on a path to <u>rapid decrease</u> of carbon emissions.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you. </span></p>
<p><span>Susan J. Ringler, a loyal fan.</span></p>

<p><b><span><span>Letter #3<a name="">&nbsp;</a></span><a name="Lett3">&nbsp;</a> </span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>Today I ask you to reflect on the third nugget of advice from Ch. Eliot: <u>imagine vividly</u>.</span></p>
<p><span>In this day of technological advancement, when machines can 
observe so much, and using algorithms, can come to reasonable 
conclusions, it is essential that great leaders take the time to imagine
 vividly. It is our imagination that leads us to empathy and most 
importantly our imagination that allows us to wonder if maybe we are 
wrong and things might be worse than they appear.</span></p>
<p><span>I urge you to imagine that we may have reached a climate 
tipping point – the consequences of which could be so dire that the 
planet will sustain far fewer humans – acidification of the oceans, die 
off of plankton ...</span></p>
<p><span>I would much rather make serious reductions to our carbon 
emissions NOW, than wait for more data. There is little harm in putting 
the brakes on carbon emissions now, and much potential good. Fossil 
fuels are a big commodity now where fortunes have been made. But oil 
needs to go the way of whalebone corsets or beaver hats. Let’s move 
forward boldly away from fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><b><span><span>Letter # 5<a name="lett5">&nbsp;</a></span></span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>On Tuesday, Joe Nocera wrote an op-ed piece in the NY Times criticizing James Hansen’s recent activism with <a href="http://350.org/" target="_blank">350.org</a> as «&nbsp;misguided.&nbsp;» </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/opinion/nocera-a-scientists-misguided-crusade.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/opinion/nocera-a-scientists-misguided-crusade.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>But I was raised to respect my elders and I can have nothing 
but respect for James Hansen getting arrested at 71 for a cause in which
 he deeply believes. Hansen spent decades as a careful scientist. He 
could be playing golf or duck hunting at 71, but instead he still works 
at NASA and has become an activist. Nocera is dismayed that Hansen has 
grown more RADICAL. Grow is the operative word here – may we all be 
still growing at 71. Hansen’s work is the bedrock of climate science 
today. He had grown radical after years of moderation have failed to 
goad us into sufficient decreases in carbon emissions. Old heroes are my
 favorites: Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks, James Hansen. They don’t lie 
down. They maintain the courage of their convictions. Maybe we should 
listen to them more – respecting their wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter #6</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>It’s snowing again today. My backyard is transformed into a 
white wonderland. I like the excuse to sit in my warm kitchen and 
cogitate on big ideas. I wish I had a larger voice, a greater stature, a
 weightier heft. I’d use them to convince people that we really need to 
decrease our greenhouse gas emissions, that climate change is going to 
harm millions of people and we can limit the harm. But why do I care 
enough to write these letters&nbsp;? It just seems we could easily cut 
back, get by with a little less. We could go slower with burning all 
this oil and enjoy the complexity and beauty of the world we live in. 
But the big voices today are all saying they need MORE – more fuel, more
 factories, more goods produced and consumed. Why do we call them 
«&nbsp;goods&nbsp;?&nbsp;» Why not «&nbsp;bads&nbsp;» or just 
«&nbsp;things&nbsp;?&nbsp;» Why do so many people with plenty think more
 stuff will make them happier&nbsp;? When has a bigger house or car or 
boat brought lasting happiness&nbsp;? I still want a bigger voice. I’d 
use that voice for caution and going slow and not hurtling recklessly 
towards large climate shifts.</span></p>
<p><span>Your voice is bigger than mine. Please use it well.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you. </span></p>
<p><span>Susan J. Ringler, One small voice.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 7<a name="lett7">&nbsp;</a></span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe someone on your staff should consider getting a binder 
for these letters. I intend to send you quite a few – maybe as many as 
350 if my stamina endures.</span></p>
<p><span>I write to you in long hand as a sign of respect. Years ago, as
 a student in Paris, I was about to type a thank you note to a professor
 when a French friend stopped me, saying that typed letters were for 
business and personal communication should always be hand-written. So 
out of respect, I pick up a pen.</span></p>
<p><span>This letter writing may well be a fool’s errand, but if I 
persist long enough I at least will be helping sustain the post office 
and demonstrating to my family and friends the depth of my concern. I 
think it is important for advanced civilizations to have a postal 
service – so I’ll support ours.</span></p>
<p><span>So once again I urge you to deny the permit for the Keystone XL
 Pipeline – with the stroke of a pen – any pen – or any pens – just 
please do it.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you</span></p>
<p><span>Susan J. Ringler, scribe.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 8</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>The scariest thing about global warming is that the earth will continue to warm for about 20 years <u>after</u>
 we stop increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. We are very far
 from stopping. We are not even significantly reducing the amount of 
annual CO2 emissions on a global scale.</span></p>
<p><span>It is time for the </span><span>United States</span><span> to 
show leadership in reducing carbon emissions. You can show that 
leadership right now by denying the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline.
 We need to burn less oil, not more. We need to quickly develop 
renewables. The time for change is NOW, You can be the leader to start 
us on this new path, or you can do nothing, say you’re not sure, say 
your hands are tied and be just another short-sighted leader who took 
the easy way out.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a clear moral imperative here. Can you hear its call?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 9</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>The French say «&nbsp;On fait ce qu’on peut.&nbsp;» - you do 
what you can. That is the reason why I am so insistent on asking you to 
stop the Keystone XL Pipeline – because you <u>CAN</u>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of
 course I would like a carbon tax, I would like more renewables, I would
 like a more robust public transportation system. But in the current 
political landscape, they seem unlikely to succeed. The Pipeline, 
however, is something you can do – just you – you can cancel it, you can
 deny the permit. It won’t stop the Tar Sands development completely, 
they’re in </span><span>Canada</span><span>, out of your control. But it will slow that development down, and send an important message that the </span><span>US</span><span> President doesn’t think 2013 is the right time for another oil pipeline. So please, do what you can.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 10</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>The NY Times editorial yesterday could not have said it 
better&nbsp;: «&nbsp; When to Say No&nbsp;» is a well-written, 
compelling piece of journalism. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/opinion/when-to-say-no-to-the-keystone-xl.html?_r=0" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/opinion/when-to-say-no-to-the-keystone-xl.html?_r=0</a></span></p>
<p><span>I’m a big fan of newspapers – the NY Times, the Guardian, Le 
Monde. I worry that with dwindling subscribers the world’s great 
newspapers will have to cut back on their international reporters. We 
will lose great depth and breadth of reporting. A picture may be worth 
1000 words for emotional content, but to parse, explain, differentiate 
our complex world there is nothing like print journalism.</span></p>
<p><span>So hats off to the NY Times and remember that when you make the
 right decision and say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline, millions of 
Americans and millions upon millions around the world will support you.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

 April 1934. I love the interplay of geometries, but most of all I look 
at the man with a fedora hat and a suit jacket. He is completely a man 
of the 30’s – no hard hat, no reflective jacket, but he is looking 
squarely into the future... while holding on firmly to a girder, He is 
an emblem for each of us. None of us can know the future, but we must 
move forward.</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>If that man is you, and the steel girder is the best available

<p><span>This was my favorite painting in the Berlin Nationalgalerie

this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Mir%C3%B3" target="_blank">Miro</a> (Small Blonde in Amusement Park 1950) and soak up the golden joy.

<p><span>Over the years this glorious image has taken on broader meaning

it <u>celebrates</u> and connects us to our environment. I sent it to you to <u>celebrate</u> all you have done for the environment and all you <u>will do</u>. Please say NO to the XL Pipeline.</span></p>

<p>  </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>The bees are in trouble. In the NY Times yesterday I read that 
the European Food Safety Authority recommends a 2-year ban on the use of
 neonicotinoids on crops attractive to bees. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/business/global/hoping-to-save-bees-europe-to-vote-on-pesticide-ban.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/business/global/hoping-to-save-bees-europe-to-vote-on-pesticide-ban.html?pagewanted=all</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The science is still not conclusive but the UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization says bees as pollinators are essential for 
feeding the planet. But today the EU failed to approve the ban, leaving 
it to individual countries.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/16/business/global/europe-vote-on-bee-harming-pesticides-is-inconclusive.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/16/business/global/europe-vote-on-bee-harming-pesticides-is-inconclusive.html</a></span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>When I do a cost/benefit analysis, that seems like a bad 
decision. There are plenty of other pesticides, there are not plenty of 
other pollinators. If we wait for more scientific proof, it could be too
 late for the bees. In the </span><span>US</span><span>, neonicotinoids 
are used on almost all of the corn crop. The EPA says additional 
research is needed. Please ask them to re-evaluate that position. Bees 
are essential, neonicotinoids are not.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 15</span></b></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Happy </span><span>St.</span><span> Patrick’s Day. I’m one-quarter Irish. I just moved to </span><span>Boston</span><span> 6 weeks ago and am getting to know the town a little. There are 2 St. Pat’s parades in </span><span>Boston</span><span>.
 The big one is run by a veteran’s group and many politicians walk in 
it. 3 years ago a Veterans for Peace group asked to take part and they 
were turned down as too political. They started an alternative march – 
just behind the regular one. The following year they were joined by 
various gay and LGBT groups. This year they are also being joined by 
environmental groups. I’m going to join them and I think others from 
350.org will be there too.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>For a lot of people there is not much point to St. Patrick’s 
Day except drinking a lot and acting silly. It seems to me that at lest 
this alternative parade is saying we are all citizens of the world and 
should get along with one another. We are all connected. Idon’t usually 
go to parades, but I’m new in town, so I’ll go to this one and maybe 
meet some interesting people.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>So please think GREEN today and turn your thoughts to doing 
good things for planet EARTH. Please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 16</span></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The other day I was telling a friend about a french poem I love – it’s about a rose and it’s by a German, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Rilke" target="_blank">R. M. Rilke</a> who lived in </span><span>Paris</span><span>. The first two lines are:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Seule abondante fleur</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tu crées ton propre espace</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>I was trying to translate “seule” and came up with:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>only – tu es ma seule amie</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>alone – je suis seule ici</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>lonely – je me sens seule</span></p>
<span></span>
<p> </p>
<p><span>But these are all wrong. It took me ages to find the correct 
English word: SINGLE – single abundant (or prolific) flower, You create 
your own space ...</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>There are negative connotations to “only, alone and lonely,” 
but SINGLE is a wonderfully powerful word. And so it is being President.
 You can single-handedly stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. You are the 
SINGLE person who can do this. We gave you these powers when we elected 
you because we want you to lead us in the right direction.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>A rose is a small thing that increases its impact with its 
wonderful fragrance. A single penstroke by you is a small thing that can
 end the XL pipeline and increase your impact on the world by the 
leadership and moral courage it embodies.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>This morning I drank my coffee from a mug I bought at the </span><span>Hyde Park</span><span> 57<sup>th</sup> Street Art Fair in 1969 or 70. I grew up in </span><span>Hyde Park</span><span>
 and still love the neighborhood. I’m proud to be a Hyde Parker and I am
 so proud that you live there. So I raise my mug to you and think of the
 marvelous interplay of urban intellectual and artistic forces I was 
exposed to in </span><span>Hyde Park</span><span>.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Like the glaze on this coffee mug, </span><span>Hyde Park</span><span> offered me flecks and flows of color and strength swirled into that mid-western melting pot that is </span><span>Chicago</span><span>. </span><span>Hyde Park</span><span> without the Art Fair would be less – as pure intellect is less without art, or soul, or moral vision.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>So as a </span><span>Hyde Park</span><span> neighbor, I ask 
youto say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline. It may be only a small fleck 
on the planet, but show your strength of purpose and just say NO.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>I can’t quite figure out why environmentalists in the </span><span>US</span><span>
 seem to fragment into so many different groups, whereas the “Let’s make
 money now – business people” seem to act more cohesively. I guess 
short-term gratification is a powerful incentive.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>But in spite of lacking any short term incentive, I will 
continue to write you these letters. It really is time to get serious 
about controlling and reducing carbon emissions. There is an urgency. 
The scientific data is uncontestable. You <u>can</u> stop the Keystone XL pipeline and it’s the right thing to do. So please do it – and then get on with other statesmanly tasks.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>There are pussy willows in the market. A sign of spring I mostly forgot about in my many years in </span><span>California</span><span>. They remind me of my mother.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>While you are visiting </span><span>Israel</span><span>, I hope
 you spend a little time thinking about how important clean water is to 
human life. As the population rises on the planet, there is more need 
for water, and the </span><span>Middle East</span><span> is certainly a 
place where that is causing more conflicts. We need to protect our water
 supplies, we need to manage them wisely, we shouldn’t let gas fracking 
waste water and pollute our aquifers.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>We also need to protect the earth’s life-sustaining moderate climate – and again the hot arid </span><span>Middle East</span><span> is a good place to think about this.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
 most important problem for the climate right now is that carbon 
emissions are too high and rising very rapidly. A carbon tax would be 
wonderful, but you can’t do that in this political climate.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>What you <u>can do</u> is stop the Keystone XL pipeline. It’s a bad idea, we should not encourage </span><span>Canada</span><span> to develop tar sands – and we certainly don’t need to pipe the dense tar sands crude all across the </span><span>US</span><span>.
 Please don’t be swayed by those interested in their own short term 
profit. Please think globally and take a leadership position. Please 
stop the Keystone XL pipeline.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Busy day, not a lot of time to compose a good letter. There are
 several stories in the NYTimes today that I don’t understand very well,
 in spite of being fairly well educated:</span></p>
<p> </p>

<p><span>the complexities of risk management (Floyd Norris) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/business/behind-the-derivatives-gibberish-risks-run-amok.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/business/behind-the-derivatives-gibberish-risks-run-amok.html?pagewanted=all</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>One could spend years delving into any one of these. So I must 
accept the fact that there is much in the world that I will never 
understand. But it would be wrong and cowardly of me not to speak out 
when I notice something <u>really important</u> that demands our 
attention. Climate change is more important than almost anything else. 
If we don’t control carbon emissions and we reach a tipping point where 
climate changes compound on each other, we may not be able to engineer 
ourselves out of the mess. So although there is much I don’t understand,
 I am convinced that we urgently need to turn around our carbon 
emissions. If we don’t, none of the rest will matter. Please cancel the 
Keystone XL pipeline. </span></p>

<p><span><b><span>Letter #21</span></b></span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>I went to </span><span>Chinatown</span><span> today and bought a
 frozen duck and brought it home and roasted it. Duck isn’t easy to find
 in an American supermarket, but you can always find it in a Chinese 
one. I guess I got a taste for duck living in </span><span>France</span><span> – so I roast one a couple of times a year. </span></p>
<p><span>My market visit toay reminded me of how Americans seem to be 
eating more and more pre-packaged and pre-processed foods. The chinese 
grocery was smaller and much simpler. It’s gotten so we expect 5000 
different products in a store. If it’s winter and we want strawberries 
there have to be frozen ones – and now fresh ones from </span><span>Chile</span><span>.
 There are frozen waffles and hash browns and and french fries and 
pizzas and hundreds of frozen dinners – none of which were in the 
chinese grocery. There I saw fresh vegetables and fresh and frozen meat 
and fish and a whole aisle of different noodles and lots of sauces and 
spices and condiments.</span></p>
<p><span>So it was good to go and be reminded that simple can be very 
tasty and it was a pleasure not to be bombarded with lots of glossy 
advertising and loud colorful boxes. </span></p>
<p><span>So when it comes time for you to decide on whether to allow or 
deny the Keystone XL Pipeline, I suggest you try to clear your mind of 
all the glossy arguments this way and that, try to get away from the 
vested interests, and think simply about whether we really need another 
pipeline or whether it wouldn’t be better to do without it.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes NO is the right answer. </span></p>
<p><span>Thank you. </span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>It is the birthday of William Morris today – the British 19<sup>th</sup>
 century designer who created so many intricate leaf and flower designs 
for fabric and wallpapers. The one I send you here is a wallpaper design
 called Fritillary from 1883.</span></p>
<p><span>I have a little book of his designs that I love to page 
through. The colors, the sweeping diagonal leaves, the way he fills up 
the entire space with lines and dots. There is a sense of abundance, of 
joyful detail that is also replete with satisfying repetition – similar 
curves occur over and over. I find much to engage my eye in a single 
design – light dark, large small, spiky smooth. How did he do it? I 
don’t know – but it’s wonderfully relaxing. When I’ve been doing too 
much right-brain work, I take an art break with William Morris and find I
 come back refreshed and thinking more clearly.</span></p>
<p><span>So enjoy art every day – even for just a few minutes – and I 
hope your left brain will help you realize that the right decision is to
 <u>Deny</u> the Keystone XL Pipeline.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a postcard from </span><span>Venice</span><span> – a 
city I’ve visited twice and consider to be one of the most magical 
places on earth. It is selfish of me – but I really don’t want </span><span>Venice</span><span> to crumble and sink because of rising sea levels. I know it is much more catastrophic for many more people for </span><span>Bangladesh</span><span> to be inundated – but I’ve never been to </span><span>Bangladesh</span><span>, so the emotional tie is much weaker.</span></p>
<p><span>This postcard is to remind you that we are all connected – that
 we are all affected by climate change – that once the heating of the 
planet speeds up we may not be able to slow it back down again. It is 
foolish to play with forces so much larger than ourselves – with 
possibly catastrophic consequences. Far better to try very hard to slow 
global warming now. So please stop the Keystone XL pipeline because <b><u>you can</u></b>. </span></p>
<p><span>And by the way, it is appalling how they let these monster cruise ships come so close to </span><span>Venice</span><span>
 and other beautiful sights. Someone ought to invent a relative 
size/population/number of bathrooms statute that could be used to keep 
them farther away. </span></p>

<p><span>(sent on a random red and white card bought at a 2<sup>nd</sup> hand store for 20 cents)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>I spent a lot of time today on the internet reading blogs about
 climate change and global warming. But these only reach the people who 
already know there is a problem. It’s like preaching to the choir. How 
can the climate change movement grow to 50 million in the </span><span>US</span><span>?
 to one billion worldwide? I have no idea. Maybe Al Gore’s strategy of 
taking billionaires and other luminaries on a trip to Antartica is the 
shorter path to success. Their money could be very influential in 
bringing about concrete change in CO2 reduction.</span></p>
<p><span>But until I can find a more productive use of my time, I’ll continue to write you letters and ask you to <b>DENY</b> the Keystone XL pipeline. You can do it and it would be an historic moment.</span></p>

<p><span><b><span>Letter #25<a name="lett25">&nbsp;</a></span></b></span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>Interesting article today in the NY Times by John Tagliabue about increased earthquakes in </span><span>Holland</span><span> after 40 years or so of natural gas extraction. <font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/world/europe/more-earthquakes-in-loppersum-the-netherlands.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/world/europe/more-earthquakes-in-loppersum-the-netherlands.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0</font></a></font></span></p>
<p><span>Recent studies have shown that “prior assumptions about the 
size of possible earthquakes were wrong.” Once again, large profits for 
oil companies and the government heavily influences the risk assessment,
 and we assumed “Everything will be fine!” Once again, after 40 years of
 damage, it turns out everything is not fine. Environmental damage is 
easy to create and very hard to fix. It’s like irresponsible drinking – 
takes a second to down another shot and hours for it to wear off. 
Responsible adults learn this after a hangover or two. So let’s be 
responsible, let’s learn from the environmental messes (read hangovers) 
we’ve caused. Let’s cut way back on damaging the environment for the 
benefit of our grandchildren – because we’ve underestimated the damamge 
so many times. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline – and fracking too 
(if you can...). the long term cost is too high.</span></p>

<p><span>I went to a thrift store today and bought this Italian stationery set made in </span><span>Firenze</span><span>, or so it is marked. It’s clearly not the handcrafter hand-colored paper (where each sheet is unique) that has been made in </span><span>Florence</span><span>
 for hundred of years. This stationery is clearly factory-made through a
 printing process. I’m happy to have bought it because REUSE is really

<p><span>I probably wouldn’t have bought this new – but by buying it at a

<p><span>Very few people benefit from the Keystone XL Pipeline. It

<p><span><b><span>Letter #27</span></b></span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>I read with interest the NY Times article on Wednesday about </span><span>Brazil</span><span>’s
 oil company Petrobras. It was written from a decidedly pro-big-business
 perspective, lamenting lower oil production and much lower profits. <span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/world/americas/petrobras-brazils-oil-giant-struggles-to-regain-lost-swagger.html?pagewanted=all"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/world/americas/petrobras-brazils-oil-giant-struggles-to-regain-lost-swagger.html?pagewanted=all</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>A business magazine is quoted saying the Brazilian is 
“destroying” Petrobras. On the flip side, the article notes that 
Petrobras has kept Brazilian unemployment low through a buy-Brazilian 
policy and that it remains profitable.</span></p>
<p><span>Petrobras is portrayed as a loser because it has gone from hugely profitable to only moderately profitable. But it seems to me </span><span>Brazil</span><span> is the winner because of the increased economic stability of more local jobs.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m basically a moderate who told my kids not to go too far in any direction. It looks to me that </span><span>Brazil</span><span>
 and Petrobras are practising moderation. They’re pumping oil more 
slowly – that’s a good thing – leaving more of it in the ground. 
Unfortunately they’re importing gas for their cars – not so good – but 
maybe it will be an incentive to adopt electric and hybrid cars more 
quickly.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s all practice moderation, heed the signs of climate change
 and work to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Please say NO to the 
Keystone XL pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span>When huge corporations refuse to practise moderation, it is 
government’s role to get them to do so. It’s your job to look beyond 
partisan squabbling to the big picture. Please lead us in the right 
direction. NO on Keystone XL. You can do it- and <b>you should</b>.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>It was the first glorious spring day on a weekend here in </span><span>Boston</span><span> today and I spent part of it having a glass of wine with a friend sitting outside. I lived in the </span><span>Bordeaux</span><span> region of </span><span>France</span><span>
 for a year and love the wines from there. They are all Cabernet/Merlot 
blends – some cabernet-heavy, others Merlot-heavy – depending on what 
grows best in that particular location. The French have been growing 
wine there for 1000 years and have learned to pay attention to local 
conditions and work with them to get the best possible outcime. They 
call it “terroir” and we should all pay attentionto local conditions – 
it’s a way to get very high quality food and wine and cause less damage 
to the environment. A win-win for everyone. So I send you a </span><span>Bordeaux</span><span>
 wine card and toast their good ideas and great wines. Please STOP the 
Keystone XL pipeline. It’s a really bad idea and we don’t need it and 
you <b>CAN</b> stop it!</span></p>

<p><span>I’m glad he’s a smart MIT professor, but he ought to be able to
 live fine on his $300K salary and not need outside consulting income 
from BP and the </span><span>Saudi</span> <span>Arabian</span> <span>Petroleum</span> <span>Studies</span> <span>Center</span><span>.
 His actions indicate that he is not a long-term thinker, but motivated 
chiefly by his own short-term gain. He does not understand the urgency 
of reducing carbon emissions and surrounds himself with other 
like-minded people. By nominating him, you indicate that <b>YOU</b> do not understand the urgency of the climate change situation. I hope this is <b>NOT</b> the case.</span></p>
<p><span>Leaders have vision to bring about a better future. Please 
demonstrate your leadership and your long-term thinking by nominating 
someone with less strong ties to big oil. But an even better way to 
demonstrate your commitment to reducing carbon emissions is to say NO to
 the Keystone XL pipeline. You can do this and you should.</span></p>

<p><span><span><b><span>Letter #31</span></b></span></span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>The Wall St. Journal on 19 March had an interesting article “Shale Gas Boom Alone Won’t Propel US Industry.” </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324392804578362781776519720.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324392804578362781776519720.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It starts by stating that natural gas in the </span><span>US</span><span> costs about $4-$5 per 1000 cubic feet, compared to $10-13 in </span><span>Europe</span><span> and $15-$20 in northeast </span><span>Asia</span><span>. But global companies like Intn’l Paper are not planning any new plants in the </span><span>US</span><span>, they are making capital investments in </span><span>China</span><span>, </span><span>India</span><span>, etc. because that’s where product <u>demand</u>
 is growing. Their investments are “driven by demand, not costs.” But 
the WSJ article goes on to say that US manufacturing jobs are growing 
slowly – there are nearly 12 million today, but that is <b>DOWN</b> from the more than 17 million in 2000. That’s 5 million skilled jobs lost that are not coming back. So cheap energy <b>does not</b> create long term skilled jobs in </span><span>America</span><span>.
 It just makes the energy companies richer and is terrible for the 
carbon it spews into the atmosphere. The way to help American jobs is by
 encouraging the <b>renewable energy sector</b>, cutting subsidies to 
Big Oil and Gas and subsidising the replacement of old leaky windows and
 doors all across America. The Keystone XL pipeline will not create long
 term jobs. It is not good for the </span><span>US</span><span> economy and it is awful for the environment. Please say NO to the Keystone XL.</span></p>

<p><span>His 3 main arguments are:</span></p>

    <li><span>Tar sands extraction is one of the world’s most environmentally damaging activities.</span></li>
    <li><span>Boon/bust cycles of petro-economies are not the basis of healthy enduring prosperous economies.</span></li>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Wow, it’s official. I’m a </span><span>Massachusetts</span><span>
 registered voter now. I have a lot to learn about local politics, but 
I’m thrilled to get the chance to vote for John Kerry’s successor in the
 Senate. I just wanted to say that I’ve always voted and always will. 
It’s so important for people to vote – even if they get frustrated with 
some of the outcomes. Voting is fundamental to democracy and I think 
fundamental to world peace.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Democracy gets undermined when 
money exerts too much power and amplifies certain voices. So don’t pay 
too much attention to the amplified voice of Big Oil – they have short

voices – who care deeply about the envoronment and human life on this 
planet. Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>I agree with the column in today’s WS Journal by George Schultz and Gary Becker in favor of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658.html</a></span></p>

<p><span>My daughter stopped by today to ask my advice about having the 
zippers on her winter boots fixed. We took them to the shoe repair shop 
and decided to spend the money on maintenance. Pipelines also need 
maintenance – thngs break, things deteriorate, things leak. There are 
lots of existing pipelines in the US and they need periodic maintenance.
 This is way more important than building new ones&nbsp;! Please say NO 
to the Keystone XL pipeline and please say YES to pushing for prompt

<p> </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Yesterday was a beautiful spring day, so I got a <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/">Zipcar</a>
 and went to the garden store. I bought 2 tomato plants and some dirt 
and planted the tomatoes in large pots on my deck. People say it is too 
early, but I’m ready to bring them inside if temperatures drop 
overnight. I’m not a huge gardener, but I love to grow tomatoes. There 
is nothing so good as a fresh-picked tomato. I’ve never found one at any
 farmer’s market that was as tasty. And they are easy to grow if you’ve 
got a sunny spot. So sometimes, yes, I just enjoy the weather, and 
embrace what nature brings day by day. But that doesn’t stop me from 
also understanding the dire long-term consequences of man-made carbon 
emissions on our climate. So I pause, trowel in hand, to ask you to 
please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline&nbsp;! It is a very bad idea 
and you can stop it. Please do so&nbsp;!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>An eerie quiet day in Boston with the whole city shut down. So 
I’ll branch out to a completely different topic&nbsp;: colors – Bright 
Colors. I’m a mosaic artist and do abstract mosaics that are all about 
color. Scientists tell us that colors are related to wavelength of 
light. But what is fasciniting to me is how colors <b><u>interact</u></b>. I made a plue and orange patio table with 2 blue plates incorporated into the mosaic. </span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span>When I place 2 orange plates over them, the whole table changes
 color. How does that happen&nbsp;? Clearly the wavelengths haven’t 
changed, but our brain processing has. The world is a complex interwoven
 web, and a beautiful one. There are thousands of different shades of 
green in nature, but dollars are only one shade. Please don’t let the 
power of one shade of green blind us to the critical needs of our entire
 environment. Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span>I’m really tired of these feel-good articles about cutting emissions. One was a 20 March column by Eduardo Porter. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/business/us-example-offers-hope-for-cutting-carbon-emissions.html?pagewanted=all">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/business/us-example-offers-hope-for-cutting-carbon-emissions.html?pagewanted=all</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Using more gas and less coal for electricity generation had cut
 CO2 emissions from electricity generation 15 percent since 2007. He 
wonders whether our carbon footprint will continue to shrink. It’s 
pleasant to read, but does not convey any sense of urgency about the 
dangers of climate change. That 15% cut is not nearly enough. The corals
 are bleaching, the oceans acidifying. We have strained the balance that
 provides a temperate climate for planet Earth. We need to combat 
complacency. We need our leaders to show us the way. Please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. Please take the long view and use your charisma 
and power to stress how urgent the climate-change problem is.</span></p>

<p><span>Here is another Golden Gate Bridge postcard showing the towers 
and a fragile structure of wires. Men worked out there in the wind over 
the water month after month to build that bridge. Humans are good at 
building and engineering their way out of problems – but we shouldn’t 
assume we can engineer our way out of too much carbon in the atmosphere.
 Maybe we can, but let’s not count on it – the risks are too high. 
Please STOP the Keystone XL pipeline to show that the US is serious 
about reducing our emissions. We need to do some engineering too –but it
 won’t be enough.</span></p>

our hearts. It is a privilege to be part of a community where people 
dedicate so much time and talent to music. In order to have thriving 
arts and music communities, we also need to have a healthy climate for 
the planet. I am <b>very concerned </b>about how much greenhouse gas we 
emit and fear greatly for our temperate climate. We need urgent change 
NOW. Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline as a first step to 
reducing our carbon emissions.</span></font></p>

WSJ that Starbucks has bought its first coffee farm – 600 acres in Costa
 Rica. It is a research farm and the impetus for their research is the 
recent rise of <b>coffee rust</b> in Latin America, a fungus that 
devastated coffee production in Asia in the late 19th century. Coffee 
rust is new to Latin America and they’re not sure why. Some think drier 
than normal weather this season could be partly to blame. Coffee and tea
 don’t grow in North America and Europe. They grow in 3rd world 
countries and we import them and imbibe large quantities. Starbucks made
 the investment because they are worried about climate change. Their 
livelihood depends on a valuable crop grown only in certain places. 
Climate change is very serious business. We ignore and downplay our 
impact on climate at our peril. Our biggest impact is fossil fuels. 
Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline. Say NO now&nbsp;! Before your

<p>  </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>I read recently about some invasive chives at a nearby pond. 
Having read this, I noticed chives in my lawn in the backyard – just a 
few here and there – certainly not invasive. But since the definition of
 a weed is a plant out of place, I dug up a few tiny bulbs from the lawn
 and transplanted them to three different flower beds with different 
amounts of sun. I like to cook with chives so would be happy for a group
 to naturalize in a corner somewhere. We’ll see how they do.</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>Transplanting and re-arranging nature is fine on a small scale,
 but the carbon our factories have been pouring into the atmosphere for 
100 years, we now find is causing all sorts of disruptions and if left 
unchecked will cause great harm.<span>&nbsp; </span>We know how 
dangerous greenhouse gases are. So please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline 
Now. It’s very important for the health of the planet.</span></p>

<p>  </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>I am more aware of spring this year than I have been in many 
years. That’s because I moved across the country this winter and have 
never seen spring in this new backyard of mine. There are flowers I 
recognize and many I don’t and as I look around at the backyard trees on
 my block, I don’t know what I’m looking at. Well that big one is 
probably a maple because it has 5-pointed leaves and heck, this IS New 
England. But what’s that one in the corner that just leafed out&nbsp;? A
 few leaves were low enough for me to pick and I used my <u>Tree-Finder Book </u>to
 identify it&nbsp;: an American Elm. I love the Tree Finder (by Mary 
Watts, copyright 1963, 1991). I used one as a kid in Chicago. It takes 
you step by step to the answer – and this little book covers 300 trees. I
 wish there were a tool like this to educate people on climate change 
and greenhouse gases. But since that’s not possible, I’ll just keep 
writing letters. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. It’s bad for the 
planet and bad for the trees.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>There has been a helicopter hovering/circling nearby for the 
past half hour. It creates an insistent sort of noise that I find 
difficult to ignore. I wish that climate change were like that 
helicopter – and would insist that we pay attention. People are pretty 
good at responding to sudden disasters, but we are not at all good at 
working on important issues that don’t flagrantly attack our 5 senses. 
So I write to you again today, a pretty, sunny, cool-ish spring day to 
ask you to <u>Please</u> say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline. The 
evidence of dangerous climate instability is mounting and we must act 
now. I urge you to hear the insistent voices of climate activists, the 
insistent voices of scientists, the insistent voices of future 
generations, the insistent voices of truth. Please do it NOW. You can 
stop that pipeline and I <u>insist</u> that you do so.</span></p>

<p>  </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>I joined the Harvest Co-op yesterday. It’s a local grocery 
store that is a co-op and stocks lots of organic and local food. By 
buying local we can support local small farms and businesses and nudge 
the country towards healthier, less factory-food practices. If I get a 
rebate at the end of the year, I’ll donate it to a local food bank. So 
many people in the world don’t have the time or means to choose what 
food they eat. they eat what they can get. They also don’t have the time
 or means to worry about climate change. They just scrape by. But 
millions of them will be affected by climate change, by floods and 
droughts. They are too poor to use much fossil fuel, but they will be 
the first ones hurt by climate disruptions. We need to cooperate more, 
governments, countries, ethnicities, to battle climate change. And we, 
the rich nations, need to step up and set an example. Cooperation and 
sharing would go a long way towards solving problems that concern all of
 us, globally. So in the spirit of cooperation, and taking a stance 
against corporate hegemony, please STOP the Keystone XL pipeline.</span></p>

think it is also customary, or shyness, or lack of time that causes 
people to NOT speak out to their leaders about issues they care about

<p>  </p>
<p><span>I used a <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/">Zip-car</a> yesterday
 to go get some groceries. I do some shopping walking, but every 10 days
 or so I get a zip-car for an hour so I can buy a bit more and stock up 
on drinks and heavier staples. Zip-car is a great idea for urban areas –
 because parking is so difficult and most people here don’t have garages
 or off-street parking. It also works because the «&nbsp;T&nbsp;», the 
subway, provides pretty decent public transport. I’m a big fan of public
 transportation because it carries lots of people where they need to go,
 while using lots less fuel than individual cars. Reducing our carbon 
usage here on planet Earth is a big job that includes lots of different 
pieces. One piece is saying NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline – that’s what
 you can do. Please do it now. It’s important for us all and makes an 
important statement by the US President.</span></p>

That’s a tragic loss of people who do so much for us all and for justice
 and human rights. As climate change grows worse, there will arise more 
wars and conflicts over water, scarce resources, less land. How many 
regional conflicts will it take, and how many dead journalists until 
Americans realize how important it is to lower greenhouse gas emissions,
 to wean ourselves from fossil fuels&nbsp;?</span></p>

<p><span>I went to a local art event «&nbsp;Open Studio&nbsp;» recently

 spoons. <a href="http://www.katherinevetne.com/">www.katherinevetne.com</a></span></p>

<p><span>She has a day job to pay the bills, but her avocation is to spend hours <b>observing keenly</b> and create a thing of beauty that causes one to realize the value of process, of doing, of participating, of creating. </span></p>

<p><span>When I went to the Lab School in the 1960’s, Hyde Park was 
fairly drab and there were few gardens. Scammons Garden, at school, was 
where I first saw Lilies of the Valley and other spring perennials. The 
Lilies of the Valley are out this week in Cambridge and I haven’t seen 
any in years, or thought much about Scammons Garden. This William Morris
 design (Eden, 1905) somehow captures that fragile delicate 
spring-flower memory of childhood. Our glorious climate is also fragile 
and needs protecting. Please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline&nbsp;! 
Do it NOW. Take a step towards reducing greenhouse gases.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>Today is my father’s birthday. He would be 101 years old. He’s 
been dead for many years but I always think of him on this day. He was a
 very intelligent self-effacing man. He didn’t care about wealth and 
status and didn’t comprehend why others did. He told us to make a 
contribution to society – to do something worthwhile and to take pride 
in that contribution.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>So it is in thinking of him that I continue writing letters to 
you. Global warming is immensely important and we need to be doing <u>much more</u>
 to reduce our use of greenhouse gases NOW. Please say NO to the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. Show the world where your values lie. This is a 
small but significant contribution that you can make now.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 77</span></b></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>I read yesterday about the new fracking laws proposed for public lands. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/us/interior-proposes-new-rules-for-fracking-on-us-land.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/us/interior-proposes-new-rules-for-fracking-on-us-land.html</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>They do <b>not</b> adequately protect the groundwater, they 
cave in to economic interests of oil and gas companies who are 
interested primarily by gain. These are <u>public</u> lands and 
resources that are being exploited for private gain. As fracking 
increases we will notice and document more environmental damage – and 
once again we will try to close the barn door <u>after</u> the horse has
 left. Fracking is only profitable if long term environmental costs are 
borne by someone else. These are public lands and future generations 
will pay for the costs of mitigation and clean up. The government is 
negligent in its duty to protect the environment. so I say NO to 
fracking NO NO NO – until it is sufficiently regulated. I also ask you, 
once again, to say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline, because you CAN, with
 a penstroke TODAY&nbsp;!</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>Mountains of petroleum coke are rising in Detroit. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/business/energy-environment/mountain-of-petroleum-coke-from-oil-sands-rises-in-detroit.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/business/energy-environment/mountain-of-petroleum-coke-from-oil-sands-rises-in-detroit.html</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>This high-sulfer, high-carbon waste is the industrial hazardous
 waste created by «&nbsp;coking&nbsp;» the first refinery process for 
oil-sands bitumen. It is so dirty and polluting that the EPA is phasing 
out US licenses to burn it. The Koch brothers buy it for chump change 
and sell what they can to poor countries where pollution controls are 
lax. The rest piles up. It is too dirty to put in a land fill. This 
waste must be regulated, it is unconscionable that we allow it to be 
sold to poor countries – and soon they will get smart and refuse to take
 it. The pile in Detroit took only 6 months to create. And BP is 
building a much bigger refinery in Indiana, over 3 times as big – so it 
will create this much waste in just <u>2 months</u>. Tar sands oil is 
only «&nbsp;profitable&nbsp;» if all this pollution and waste is 
ignored. Say NO to Keystone XL Pipeline and say NO to the pet-coke 
garbage it creates.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter #79</span></b></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span>I’m still fuming about the piles of pet-coke that I read about 
yesterday. The cost of properly disposing of this awful residue MUST be 
paid by the oil industry who creates it. Tar sands oil is NOT cheap, it 
is not good for the US economy when total disposal and pollution costs 
are counted. Canada has 80 million tons of pet-coke piled up. And 
Canadians only put up with it because it’s kept <u>out of sight</u>&nbsp;! The US cannot stop Canada from extracting oil from tar sands, but we <u>can</u> stop them from leaving their pet-coke piles everywhere. They must <u>pay</u>
 to dispose of any waste from refining bitumen. That’s how Capitalism is
 supposed to work. When you add the clean-up costs, the costs of the oil
 goes</span><span> way up. It’s no longer profitable. That keeps the Tar
 Sands Oil in the ground&nbsp;! Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Stop it 
NOW&nbsp;! We don’t want Canada’s small-grain, high sulfer pet-coke.</span>

<p> </p>
<p><span>We have been pumping too much water out too quickly. The price 
of water is so cheap and the price of corn is so high that it has made 
sense for farmers to pump and pump and grow more and more corn. We need 
to end the corn subsidies – or reduce them – our agricultural policies 
don’t make sense – nor do our energy policies. There are danger signs 
everywhere. We need to do much more to protect resources like 
groundwater that are very difficult to replace. Similarly we need to 
protect the climate and reduce carbon emissions. Please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline NOW.</span></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;"><span>This is one of my very favorite 
postcards – and I’ve had it for years. What possessed the artist to draw
 four men shoveling chairs? And why is it this shape? as if meant to go 
over a doorway perhaps? I love the diversity of art that we humans 
create. I love the temperate climate over most of our planet that allows
 us the leisure to create such art, to develop our ideas, philosophies, 
literatures. Extreme climate change can put much of that in jeopardy. 
Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Please take a stance on climate 
change. Don’t shovel the warning signs under a rug. </span></font></p>

</font>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><font style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I write to urge you to set funding for public transit at </font><b><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>the level of $800 million passed by the Senate</u>.</font>&nbsp; </b><font style="font-size: 12px;">The
 $500M approved by the House is far too little to maintain and improve 
our state’s vital transportation network. I am very concerned about 
getting prepared for future climate disruptions and maintaining and 
growing public transit is critical to this end.&nbsp; By being 
forward-looking on transportation infrastructure, MA stands to be an 
economic leader as well. </font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
    <font style="font-size: 12px;">Higher funding for public transit means:</font>
</p>
<span></span><blockquote style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" indent="indent">
<ul>
    <li><font style="font-size: 12px;">creating many new maintenance, repair and construction jobs </font></li>
    <li><font style="font-size: 12px;">boost to economy: businesses and consumers benefit by less time spent in traffic</font></li>
    <font style="font-size: 12px;">
    </font>
    <li><font style="font-size: 12px;">significant environmental improvement getting people out of their cars (so less greenhouse gas emissions.</font></li>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><font style="font-size: 12px;">I also support a 3 cent gas tax increase, and yes I drive a car.</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><font style="font-size: 12px;">Thank you

the needed transit expansions.</font><span>&nbsp; </span></p>

 them last night – red and yellow beets – just washed them and put them 
whole on a baking sheet with a little oil. I baked them over an hour, 
then let them cool. Today I peeled and diced them and tossed them in 
vinaigrette – yum. I guess I just enjoy cooking. Interesting that the 
french verb “to cook” is “cuisiner” – to kitchen – cuisine is kitchen 
and also food. So the word “cuisiner” covers <u>all</u> food 
preparation, like salad-making, whether or not it involves heat and 
cooking. So I like to “cuisine”, to work with my hands to prepare food. 
It is fundamental and fun and creative. But in order to have the rich 
diversity of foods and cultures on this planet, we need a temperate 
CLIMATE. We need to cut way back on fossil fuels and the greenhouse 
gases they emit. </span></font></p>

 love about the haiku tradition is that haiku very often include some 
natural object, or reference to nature’s seasons or processes. This 
reminds us that we are connected to nature, that we are part of it. 
Climate change is a vast and complex problem that we must face, and the 
sooner we lessen the carbon we burn, the better for us all.</span></font></p>

 I bought there in 1976. It’s intended for writing vertically, but 
rotated 90 degrees it works for us “round eyes” too. Writing in 
notebooks, keeping track of things, these are activities we humans have 
pursued for thousands of years. But what will the next even 200 years on
 planet Earth look like? If we don’t quickly curb carbon emissions it 
could look very very UGLY. Global warming is the most urgent problem 
this generation faces. If the climate spins out of control under our 
watch, we will be vilified by future generations. </font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I walked the 5-mile AIDS walk in 
Boston yesterday with some friends. It was really hot – 92 F or so and 
we wore hats and drank lots of water. It has gone from 55 to 90 degrees 
in 4 days here, and I have read that these abrupt temperature swings are
 linked to the jet stream getting stalled – something we will probably 
see lots more of. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/spring-delayed-europe-shivers/"><font color="#0000ff">http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/spring-delayed-europe-shivers/</font></a></font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">It was great to see a wide assortment 
of people walking to combat AIDS, including middle school kids and 
younger. The US has improved the social justice landscape quite a bit in
 the last 30 or 40 years, and that is to be applauded. But there is much
 less awareness of the </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>urgency</u><font style="font-size: 12px;">
 of curbing carbon emissions. We really need to get moving very quickly.
 Please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline and show the country your 
leadership on trying to slow the warming planet. The time for action is 
NOW.</font></font></p>

 and US sources to American refineries. That’s 800,000 barrels a day 
that we won’t need to import from countries that don’t always share our

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I am encouraged by this. It means the

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;">I wonder if global warming and green house gases will even be mentioned. Probably not. But the fact is that t</font>he
 current energy policies of both the US and China are unsustainable. We

 is such a scripted political statement. It is a bland

of climate change is so great that offending no one is no longer a 
defensible position. I also take grave exception to your statement that 
our natural gas reserves “can last nearly 100 years ... can power our 
cars ... in a cleaner way.” We cannot afford the environmental and 
climate disasters of continuing to burn those reserves for even 20 
years. We need to change our energy habits radically and quickly. The 
science is clear. We cannot just continue with business as usual. Please
 do not pander to the business-as-usual oil executives. Please say NO to

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">It is caused by lots of moist air and a
 strong low pressure system. In other articles meteorologists talk about
 the jet stream bending, about weather stalling over certain areas 
instead of just passing across. These stalled weather patterns are 
becoming much more common. They cause large floods, longer droughts, 
more severe weather of all kinds. We have caused these disruptions by 
pumping so much carbon into the atmosphere. We are in for a rough ride. 
We need to take proper heed of these clear and ominous 
weather-disruption events. We need to quickly stop the flow of 
greenhouse gases.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Yesterday there was an article in the 
NY Times reporting that farm subsidies for irrigation equipment have led
 to MORE water use and contribute to the depletion of ground water 
aquifers.</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/us/irrigation-subsidies-leading-to-more-water-use.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/us/irrigation-subsidies-leading-to-more-water-use.html</a></font> </p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">The population of the US has doubled 
in 50 years and water use has tripled. 80% of water use in the US is for
 farm irrigation. We currently grow farm surpluses to the peril of our 
aquifers. Our farm subsidies and agricultural management have enriched 
Monsanto, ADM, Cargill. They need to be overhauled to protect our water,
 our climate, our beautiful and bountiful country. I am glad these 
issues have become newsworthy, but saddened at how much climate damage 
it has taken. And how much more will it take?</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Environmental damage is incredibly 
difficult to reverse. Water is not just for those who grab it first. 
Greenhouse gases jurt us all, even if we can’t see the effect in 10 
minutes. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Please show the 
leadership on climate and environmental degradation.</font></p>

Well, some of the pet-coke from Detroit has been shipped to Nova Scotia and is b</font>eing
 used to make electricity by Nova Scotia power because “it saves our 
customers money.” So if you make dirty pet-coke cheap enough, virtually 
giving it away, and you can find a place with insufficient pollution 
standards, you can find someone to burn it. But even then the 
“WATERFRONT PILE CONTINUES TO GROW.” We do not need and do not want

sort of like trying to hula-hoop and hop at the same time .... or 
something. My imagery may be silly, but you get the idea. So 
congratulations to the engineers on this project and to the DOE for 
funding it. We need lots of new technologies like these to make GREEN

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I was pleased to read last week that the Northern Gateway 
pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia is in trouble. The province of
 BC has urged the Canadian government to reject it. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/01/business/energy-environment/british-columbia-opposes-planned-oil-sands-pipeline.html?_r=0"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/01/business/energy-environment/british-columbia-opposes-planned-oil-sands-pipeline.html?_r=0</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>This pipeline is the backup plan to the Keystone pipeline and 
BC environmentalists oppose it citing pollution and environmental damage
 from spills. They are right to oppose it&nbsp;! Neither pipeline should
 be built. If Canadians don’t want tar sands in BC, then we certainly 
shouldn’t let Canada pipe tar sands across the US.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sensible
 citizens of Canada and the US oppose these pipelines. Listen to them. 
Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline. Do not let Canada dump its 
dirty tar sands and pet-coke on us.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On Monday I read that the Senate had passed this year’s farm bill, finally. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/us/politics/senate-passes-farm-bill-house-vote-is-less-sure.html"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/us/politics/senate-passes-farm-bill-house-vote-is-less-sure.html</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>The last farm bill passed by <u>both</u> houses was in 2008 – 
that’s 5 years ago – so we’ll see what the House of Reps. does with this
 one. The good news is $5 billion cuts to crop subsidies (paying farmers
 to not plant). The bad news is $4 billion cuts to food stamps and no 
change to food aid and crop insurance programs. I am embarrassed to be 
an American. This bill is all about big-agri-business and their control 
of politics. None of these people seem to understand that climate change
 is urgent – that we are facing bigger and bigger floods and droughts 
and we need to seriously rethink our carbon life style. Please say NO to
 the Keystone XL pipeline. Show that you understand the urgency of 
climate change. Stop the subsidies to huge businesses – they are stuck 
in the past. We need to move forward on climate change.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is from a postcard of a Paracas textile that I bought in 
Peru in 1984. I love the colors, the zany flowing arms and legs, the 
sense of movement. Paracas textiles are very old, very complex, and not 
well understood. Piles of new clothes in all sizes from doll-size to 
giant have been found in tombs. They seem to come from a culture where 
weaving and embroidery were valued for themselves – an art, a process, 
not a means of production.</span></p>
<p><span>We could learn from them. We could value art more – not as 
objects – but the process of creating, of weaving, of dancing, of 
musicians. These should be our heroes, not the titans of wealth and 
commodities who continue to cause huge environmental damage. We are 
standing on the brink of climate disaster – we must very quickly reverse
 the global warming. But so many people are caught up in the dazzle of 
short term wealth, they fail to see the enormity of the environmental 
toll.</span></p>
<p><span>Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline. We don’t need the 
Tar Sands oil – it is dirty – the environmental costs are way too high.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A small article in the NY Times today tells us that the EPA is 
suing Exxon Mobil over a spill of Canadian crude oil in Arkansas on 
March 29th. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/us/arkansas-exxon-is-sued-over-march-pipeline-spill.html"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/us/arkansas-exxon-is-sued-over-march-pipeline-spill.html</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>The spill <u>continues</u> to pollute rivers and streams. This 
is unconscionable. This ongoing spill from the Pegasus pipeline 
demonstrates the environmental damage of <u>all</u> pipelines and also 
demonstrates the oil industry’s cavalier attitude towards repairs. As 
long as the spill is not too big and doesn’t attract too much attention,
 then the cleanup can be ignored. This just proves why we need to 
regulate the oil industry – and regulate them <u>more</u> than we have so far. For every barrel of oil piped through a pipeline in the US, the EPA and Justice Dept. should receive a <u>use-fee</u>
 from the oil industry that they can spend on swift and effective 
ENFORCEMENT. NO more pipelines until we stop all existing leaks quickly.
 Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline, another disaster waiting to 
happen.</span></p>

<p><span>This is important work and I commend them for their painstaking
 pursuit of many many small leaks. Chipping away at a problem is not 
dramatic and so is not often given sufficient press coverage. Grass 
roots movements are similar. I would like to take this moment to <u>commend</u>

pipeline. They are trying to chip away at the problem of greenhouse 
gases too&nbsp;! Please pay attention to the ever-growing movement

<p><span>The solution for these native Americans is NOT coal. Instead 
someone ought to help them invest in renewable energy, wind, solar, 
geothermal. This is where the future lies. The US government should be 
providing all sorts of incentives to the development of allsorts of 
renewable energy. The Crow Nation deserves a decent income, but it 
should be based on <u>clean technology</u>. We should not export coal because the greenhouse gases emitted from coal affect us all, no matter <u>where</u> in the world it is burned&nbsp;!

This concentration of tens of millions of tons of manure in specific 
locations poses an enormous hazard to our waterways. It is 
unconscionable that the EPA retreats before this powerful industry – 
even from fact collection. Factory farms should not be able to hide 
their mega-polluting from the public, nor should the oil industry. If 
more people watched the documentary film Petropolis, <cite><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.petropolis-film.com/">www.<b>petropolis</b>-<b>film</b>.com</a></font></font></cite>
 fewer people would favor oil from tar sands. It’s a filthy process with
 environmental costs that are way too high. While you are waiting for 
Senate confirmation of your EPA nominee, please say NO to the Keystone 
XL Pipeline. It is an important small step. </span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 111</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday I went on a tour of a single stream recycling center 
with conveyors and magnets and air currents to separate the metals and 
different types of plastics. It’s pretty good technology and really fun 
to watch, but the sad part is that there is not much market for recycled
 materials. Some like the PET plastic have an active market, but mixed 
paper isn’t worth much – nor are the plastics labeled 3 through 7. We 
ship most of it off to </span><span>Asia</span><span>. We really are 
drowning in packaging: plastic bags, plastic clam shell cases, plastic 
meat trays, plastic cups – and the amount of all these petroleum-based 
plastics that get recycled varies from town to town, state to state, and
 a great deal still ends up in landfills. Plastic packaging is 
everywhere because it is cheap. But it is not really cheap if we use oil
 to make it, and oil to transport it across the world before it can be 
reused. We need to be using <u>less</u> oil, not <u>more</u>. We need to
 stop making plastic that is used for a very short time and thrown out. 
We need to be more careful about greenhouse gas emissions. Please stop 
the Keystone XL pipeline. Please stop it now.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I return today to an article 3 weeks ago about two competing 
groups that certify “green” products. One is the SFI (Sustainable 
Forestry Initiative) funded by the logging industry and the other is the
 FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) a more global group with ties to 
environmental advocacy groups. </span></p>

<p><span>To its credit, the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) is trying to 
crack down on false “green” claims and has new guidelines to follow. But
 this highlights what an important marketing tool a “green” label is! 
The underlying truth here is that people do not want to trash the 
environment or change the planet’s climate to the detriment of future 
generations. We need you and the </span><span>US</span><span> government
 to help us achieve these goals. Wipe out false advertising and Please

<p><span><br>
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>You have recently increased the “price” of the “Social Cost of 
Carbon.” This is a laudable effort to account for the health costs, 
mitigation costs, and so forth of each additional ton of CO2 in the 
atmosphere. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/us/politics/new-effort-to-quantify-social-cost-of-pollution.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/us/politics/new-effort-to-quantify-social-cost-of-pollution.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>But those in the oil industry who have a vested interest in 
business (and profit) as usual, maintain that the future impacts of 
climate change are <u>unknown</u> so it is too soon to quantify them. 
It’s a bit like saying I’ll wait until I find out just how hot that 
dragon’s breath is before deciding how far to run! Climate change is an 
urgent new challenge for humanity and we cannot afford to wait any 
longer. The climate brakes <u>must</u> be put on! We must quickly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Stop it today!</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yesteday I attended my first meeting of the Cambridge City 
Council and I spoke in favor of a citizens zoning petition. For new 
buildings 25000 sq ft and more, the petition requires that the building 
be “net-zero” GHG emissions. The building can achieve this goal by 
various means, one of which is to purchase renewable energy from a local
 provider, such as the soon to be built </span><span>Cape</span> <span>Wind</span><span> wind farm off </span><span>Cape Cod</span><span>.
 This is decried by some developers as draconian, but it is not much 
more expensive now, and in future decades will be much cheaper. The 
price of fossil fuels will <u>increase</u> and the price of renewables will <u>decrease</u>. This is smart forward-looking development that is practised in </span><span>Europe</span><span> and elsewhere. It was called “bold” last night but that is only because the </span><span>US</span><span>
 is so far behind in green building. We need to attack this carbon 
problem on many fronts. Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline as a 
first good step towards a greener planet.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for speaking out about the perils of climate change yesterday and outlining steps you will take. <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/obamas-global-warming-action-plan/">http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/obamas-global-warming-action-plan/</a></span></p>
<p><span>I certainly hope that you “will have the courage to act before 
it is too late.” Your pledge to reduce GHG emissions by 17% by 2020 is 
probabaly too little too late. This is a very urgent world problem and 
the </span><span>US</span><span> must take leadership. Thank you for 
mentioning the Keystone XL pipeline, even though your remarks have been 
praised by both opponents and supporters of the pipeline. What we need 
now is an end of talk, and a beginning of <b>action. </b>Please cancel 
the Keystone XL pipeline NOW. Michael Brune is correct, the pipeline 
would significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution. Please 
act NOW before it is too late.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 117</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>I enjoyed the article today about </span><span>Canada</span><span> trying to clean up the various aspects of producing oil from tar sands. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/business/energy-environment/oil-industry-in-canada-bolsters-efforts-for-cleaner-production.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/business/energy-environment/oil-industry-in-canada-bolsters-efforts-for-cleaner-production.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>But apparently the best case projection is that carbon 
emissions could be cut by 30% over the next 20 years. That’s not nearly 
enough. They admit themselves that if their production increases as they
 would like, overall emissions from tar sands will increase. Pumping 
that amount of carbon into the air just to make oil, that will pump <u>more</u> carbon into the air when it is burned, is <b>morally untenable</b>.
 I hope that articles like this make it very clear why Tar Sands need to
 be left in the grould. Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline. It is
 way too polluting for any responsible leader to condone. We need to put
 the brakes on carbon emissions very quickly. Please do your part. Say 
NO to KXL.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span>I can’t believe I’ve written you so many letters and failed to mention Susan Freinkel’s excellent book: <u>Plastic: A Toxic Love Story</u>
 (2011). I’ve learned so many details from her and she writes clearly

on our complex relationship with plastics. From her I learned that </span><span>the
 building blocks of plastics are petro-chemicals, by-products of 
petroleum refinery. We refine a lot of oil, make a lot of chemical 
by-products and combine these chemicals into abundant, cheap, convenient
 items made of different plastics. But now we have found that petroleum 
products incur huge costs to our planet, its environment and its

<p><span>The Verizon phone/internet repairmen came for the third time 
this week and finally fixed my internet problem today. Men in bucket 
trucks have spent hours fiddling with equipment up telephone poles for 
me and presumably my neighbors with similar problems. We live in an age 
when we <b>expect</b> inter-connection by phone and computer at all times. But oddly there is little spillover to <b>actions</b> of interconnection, to understanding that we must work together as the population rises and we must <b>all</b> protect the climate and environment. A major way that individuals connect to the larger world is through their <b>government leaders</b>. So it is <b>imperative</b> that if the little guy doesn’t always see the connection, the <b>leaders</b>
 must consider the needs of us all on this planet. As leader of one of 
the largest and wealthiest countries, it is your duty to act NOW on

<p><span>from an orchard in </span><span>Saratoga</span><span>. These 
are the best apricots I’ve found for jam with fabulous tangy flavor, and
 unfortunately this is the last commercial orchard of these Blenheims 
that I know of. They used to be grown all over </span><span>Santa Clara</span><span> valley but because of </span><span>Silicon Valley</span><span>,
 the land got too expensive for orchards. They moved the orchards to 
much hotter areas south and east and grow a different apricot – huge and

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The apricots are at their peak around July 4<sup>th</sup>.
 I made 21 jars and gave 11 away to 11 different families in CA and 
brought 10 home here. I will eat it all year and think of the fabulous 
connection to the soil that nurtures them, the temperate climate, and

<p><span>Today I go back to thinking about Susan Freinkel’s book <u>Plastic</u>. <a href="http://susanfreinkel.com/books_Plastic.html">http://susanfreinkel.com/books_Plastic.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>It is not that plastic is an evil product, anyone who needs a 
IV bag is happy they were invented – and are made out of plastic. The 
problem seems to be that plastic is so cheap <b>to produce</b> that is 
it the “cheapest” way to solve most consumer goods issues: eye catching 
colored bottles for shampoo, large packages for DVDs, convenient 
one-serving drink bottles and pouches, snack packages from chips to 
power-bars (that are really candy), fruit and veg packages for 
freshness. </span></p>
<p><span>We use most of these things for a very short time and then 
dispose of them, most end in landfills, some are recycled, many end up 
as confetti in the oceans. So plastics are not “cheap” for the 
environment because they are difficult to bio-degrade. Let’s look at the
 big picture, oil and its byproducts damage the climate and the 
environment. We need less, not more oil. Please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline NOW. Show your strength of character. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Well I missed another few days. During that time I joined a group of urban gardeners on a weed-out. <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Water/freshpondreservation/getinvolved/volunteerwithfreshpondreservation/podpatrol.aspx">https://www.cambridgema.gov/Water/freshpondreservation/getinvolved/volunteerwithfreshpondreservation/podpatrol.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>We have a local invasive weed called Black Swallow-wort, and if
 you can catch it before the pods burst, you can greatly curtail the 
seed spread. So off we went, along a chain link fence at Fresh Pond, a 
lovely pond that is also the water supply for </span><span>Cambridge</span><span>.
 We worked hard for 2 hours, got a lot of pods, but it is a daunting 
task. There is still much to do. It’s a bit like climate change: an 
incredibly daunting task! But we each need to try and make a<span>&nbsp; </span>difference,
 to inch us forward. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. You can do it
 today. Please don’t put off this important task. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve joined another interesting urban gardening group. This one is called the League of Urban Canners. <a href="http://leagueofurbancanners.org/">http://leagueofurbancanners.org/</a></span></p>
<p><span>They have a database of fruit trees in </span><span>Cambridge</span><span>
 that are either on public walkways, or they have contacted the owner 
and gotten permission to harvest. Then they make jam and the owner gets 
10%, the pickers 20% and the canners 70%. I found an Apricot tree nearby
 and was particularly interested because of my recent success making 
excellent jam in </span><span>California</span><span> from Blenheim apricots.</span></p>
<p><span>Well this was fun, but the fruit is not as flavorful, and so 
the jam was way more mundane. There are only a few apricots that produce
 fruit in the North East. They have to flower later. I’m not sure 
exactly which variety this backyard tree was, but it was a lot of work. 
Much of the fruit had scab on the outside, so I had to spend a lot of 
time cutting the fruit. It makes me appreciate my </span><span>California</span><span>
 jam even more. Let’s tend our garden, as Candide would say. Let’s tend 
our planet. Let’s not mess up the balance even more. Please say NO to 
the Keystone XL Pipeline. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>Today I am cooking dinner for 8 for a Transportation Working 
Group meeting at my house. You might wonder what Transportation has to 
do with climate change, and actually it’s an important piece. Parts of 
the country with better transportation, that is <b>public transportation</b>,
 contribute less per capita to the transportation part of our carbon 
emissions. This is important and city and state governments need to be 
constantly nudged into funding public transportation.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span>On July 11<sup>th</sup> the NY Times reported on a new report 
from the Dept. of Energy stating that our energy grid will be severely 
affected by storms and other weather events driven by <b>climate change</b>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/us/climate-change-will-cause-more-energy-breakdowns-us-warns.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/us/climate-change-will-cause-more-energy-breakdowns-us-warns.html</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Jonathan Pershing of the DOE states that we don’t have a robust energy system, and what we <b>do</b>
 have, we need to strengthen now. These problems are unavoidable because
 of the amount of GH gases already in the atmosphere. This report 
focuses on mitigation and asks people to strengthen all parts of the 
energy infrastructure. I’m glad mitigation is more widely accepted and 
less controversial, but all the mitigation in the world won’t help us if
 we don’t <b>stop the increase</b> of CO2 in the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>We need to cut back on fossil fuels dramatically and 
immediately. The science is clear. Please stop toe Keystone XL Pipeline 
as a small first step.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>I write today about another power grid article, NY Times 13 
July, revealing how our energy grid is made up of hundreds of different 
owners and stakeholders and how electricity has to be sent somewhere 
immediately or it is useless. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/us/ideas-to-bolster-power-grid-run-up-against-the-systems-many-owners.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/us/ideas-to-bolster-power-grid-run-up-against-the-systems-many-owners.html</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The technology is available, but the grid remains mostly 
regional, not national, and highly inefficient. It looks to me that we 
need more collaboration and less competition, and that is going to be 
difficult to achieve. Unfortunately we may need a few more big weather 
disasters before people understand that we need to work together. You 
can help shorten the time it takes people to understand that <b>climate change</b>
 is a very serious problem, and we need to be cutting back on fossil 
fuels NOW. Please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline and show you 
seriously want to help lessen the climate changes we will have to 
endure.</span></p>

<p><span>I was heartened today to read that the SouthEast Louisiana 
Flood Protection Authority is suing dozens of energy companies for 
decades of wetlands damage caused by cutting thousands of miles of 
pipelines and access canals across these under-appreciated ecosystems. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/us/louisiana-agency-to-sue-energy-companies-for-wetland-damage.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/us/louisiana-agency-to-sue-energy-companies-for-wetland-damage.html</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The lawsuit was denounced by the </span><span>Louisiana</span><span>
 governor, but may well be a catalyst for other lawsuits. The lesson is,
 be careful what you undervalue. We called them swamps and thought they 
were useless, but now we realize that levees alone can’t protect coastal
 cities. We also have undervalued for years the delicate balance of 
gases in our atmosphere that allows our climate to be so propitious. We 
are increasing the amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases to our great
 peril. We need to cut back NOW. Please say NO to the Keystone XL

<p> </p>
<p><span>This is clearly <b>not</b> the case. Manning is a deeply 
ethical person, not a traitor. We would not be having public debates 
about the morality of drone strikes or the NSA’s invasive electronic 
surveillance without principled individual whistle-blowers like Manning 
and Snowden. They are heroes in the fight Against abuse of power. Also 
chilling is the description of armed Military Police pacing behind the 
journalists watching the testimony on video feed and looking over their 
shoulders. I admire whistle-blowers and journalists who stand up to 
intimidation and continue to shed light on dark corners of our world. 
Take a lesson from their moral courage and say <b>NO</b> to the Keystone
 XL Pipeline. Climate change can ruin the planet for future generations,
 you can help avoid that by taking a stand today. You can blow the 
whistle on the true cost of fossil fuels. Do it now, please.</span></p>

profitable energy company. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/your-money/asset-allocation/seeking-light-amid-the-heat-of-energy-investments.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/your-money/asset-allocation/seeking-light-amid-the-heat-of-energy-investments.html</a> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>He talked to analysts and some suggested the money was going to
 be made in drilling equipment, others in pipeline companies. They all 
agreed the </span><span>US</span><span> would be the world’s largest 
producer of natural gas in 2015, and of oil in 2017. Renewables are 
portrayed as too risky because they are only profitable when the 
government supports them. Sullivan compares oil and gas today to the 
Internet of 1985. He blindly assumes that oil and gas will just go on 
being hugely profitable for the next 30 years. But the climate change is
 going to be so great in the next 10 years, that people are going to 
stop investing in more oil and gas. Sullivan and the industry analysts 
he quotes, completely ignore climate science to their peril and OURS. 
The next 30 years will bring big changes to our energy landscape. Please
 say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline and set us going in the right 
direction. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>I was interested in the article about tools to increase the resiliency of our electric grid in Thursday’s paper. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/business/new-tools-for-keeping-the-lights-on.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/business/new-tools-for-keeping-the-lights-on.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>I am glad to know about phasor measurement units and hope we 
install lots of them very soon. The amount of carbon we have already 
pumped into the atmosphere guarantees that we will stress our electric 
grid with storms and weather extremes. So these tools will be very 
helpful. But they are not enough! We need to reduce our emissions 
drastically NOW! Please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline as an 
important first step.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Last week 4 Republican former heads of the EPA wrote a NYTimes 
column urging immediate substantive action to curb climate change. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/opinion/a-republican-case-for-climate-action.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/opinion/a-republican-case-for-climate-action.html</a>? </span></p>
<p><span>They propose a carbon tax and investment in clean energy. They 
understand how dangerous this problem is. How many more high-profile 
moderates will it take until this country is spurred to action? <u>“There is no time to waste.”</u>
 Please do your part immediately. Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. We need
 bold action NOW. The only uncertainty is “how bad the changes will 
get.” Do not hold future generations hostage to the stupidity and 
self-interest of a few. Please act now. Do what you can.</span></p>

 to determine how much drug-resistant e-coli in animals is causing 
illness in people. </span></p>

<p><span>He is comparing e-coli in meat samples to e-coli that have 
caused urinary tract infections. He is certain that we need to 
dramatically cut antibiotic use in farming – and is trying to get the 
data to prove it – before it is too late and we have broad outbreaks of 
drug-resistant diseases in humans. This is parallel to the global 
warming crisis. Vested interests stall and hinder the government from 
doing what is best for us all. They insist there is no hard data. As a 
leader, you need to push through the clutter and get us on the right 
long term path. Please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline. Please do it

<p><span>To make this little sketch, Matisse turned his paper and used 
different areas of it. This is easy to do with paper, but hard to do 
with national policy. Technocrats get stuck in one linear mode. They are
 trained to collect data, compile it, draw conclusions and report. If 
they act otherwise, they are not serious.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span>A few days ago I spoke at a Cambridge City Planning Board 
meeting and urged them to require that a new biolab – 225,000 sq feet 
proposed for construction – be “net-zero carbon” – that is, cause no net
 carbon emissions increase from the building operation. The Planning 
Board will respond later, but what was most heartening was that a number
 of citizens who were there to speak on other matters, heard us and said
 they also supported our request. This is grass roots <b>in action</b>. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>It is difficult to get people to go to a city council meeting, 
or speak out on an issue, but often when one does, one feels a certain 
solidarity with other activists. So please show your solidarity with 
climate activists and say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline. It’s important
 that you pick up that pen and say NO NOW. Climate change is an urgent 
problem.</span></p>

<p><span>A leak at the Royal Canadian Air Force base in </span><span>Cold Lake</span><span>, </span><span>Alberta</span><span> continues to spill tar sands oil – as it has since June. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/business/global/leak-at-oil-sands-project-in-alberta-heightens-conservationists-concerns.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/business/global/leak-at-oil-sands-project-in-alberta-heightens-conservationists-concerns.html</a></span></p>

<p><span>The company <b>Canadian Natural Resources</b> does not know the
 cause of the 4 leaks, says they are manageable, and that the oil is 
leaking from poorly sealed old wells. The newly formed Alberta Energy 
Regulator is not so sure and suggests that high-pressure steam may be a 
contributing factor. A previous gov’t study on a 2009 leak did </span><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">not</span></b><span>
 determine the cause. There is clearly much we don’t know about these 
leaks and we won’t be able to prevent future leaks before we understand 
the science better. It is folly to continue tar sands exploration 
without sufficient scientific knowledge. Please say NO to the Keystone

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>They sometimes have to cut back the energy from the wind farms 
because it could overload the grid. “It’s literally the size of the 
line.” So all we need is to beef up our grid with fatter wires and 
smarter computer switches. The grid operators need to be incentivized to
 <b>embrace</b> renewables – not to discourage and curtail their use. Climate change is a <b>huge</b> and urgent problem. There need to be many changes by many people. The one you can do <b>NOW</b> is deny the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. We don’t want that dirty oil and we shouldn’t help </span><span>Canada</span><span> export it to </span><span>Asia</span><span>. Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today.</span></p>

 2/3 of all fossil fuel in the ground. </span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span>So clean energy is an issue of <b>ethics</b>. The economics 
will kick in much later – when it is too late to turn climate change 
around. How ethical are you? How ethical is each of us? I certainly have
 a carbon footprint but would be happy to be taxed for it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>So please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline and say yes to 
reducing the speed of global warming. Ethics is our understanding that 
there is a larger good. For all of us and our descendents, let’s do the 
right thing. No more delays.</span></p>

<p><span>What is so interesting about this beautiful renaissance staircase in </span><span>Venice</span><span>, is that it is hidden down a narrow path to an inner courtyard. All the front doors of </span><span>Venice</span><span>
 are on canals, so this gem was hidden away. What a glorious and 
unexpected pleasure to come upon it. Some art is made for the social

<p><span>I just spent 2 weeks at the beach in France – toured some Medoc

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>I stored the belongings of 5 college students at my house over 
the summer, and now they have all come and picked up their things. My 
basement seems a bit empty.</span></p>
<p><span>These are wonderful energetic socially-conscious optimistic 
young people. but what is sad is that they will suffer more from global 
warming and the resulting climate instability than I will.</span></p>
<p><span>When I was their age I had no idea that just burning fossil 
fuel would cause huge problems. I knew about air pollution, but not 
greenhouse gases. So I’m part of the problem and therefore would like to
 rein in our GHG emissions as rapidly as possible. Please Stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. It’s important to take this small step away from 
digging up more dirty oil. Do it for them.</span></p>
<p><span>I know you are focused on how to punish Assad in </span><span>Syria</span><span> for using chemical weapons, but this is important too. It would only take a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>I’m still thinking about my 2 weeks in </span><span>France</span><span>
 at the beach on the Atlantic coast. They pay $8 a gallon for gas for 
their cars and the economy does not grind to a halt. So they pay more up
 front for the carbon they emit. The </span><span>US</span><span> really
 needs to get active about cutting GHG (greenhouse gases). We just 
dawdle along and emit more,way more than we could. Let’s get serious 
about carbon emissions – it’s really important for a healthy planet. 
Please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline. Please, please, please.</span></p>

<p><span>This is a Hokusai print from 1832 in the </span><span>Guimet</span> <span>Museum</span><span> in </span><span>Paris</span><span>. Although the waves are momentous, one feels that the humans will make it through. This, like many other 19<sup>th</sup>
 century images of man in nature, depicts man as resourceful, 
persistent, even wily. There is not yet any sense that we could do 
irreparable harm to nature. But we know NOW that we have done <b>great</b>
 harm and can only hope that we slow the emission of greenhouse gases 
sufficiently to avoid irreparable harm. Please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline. It can only add to the environmental damage of water, land,

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I was proud to see that an article on the campus fossil-fuel divestment movement appeared on the <b>first</b> page of the Business section yesterday. <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/a-new-divestment-focus-fossil-fuels/">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/a-new-divestment-focus-fossil-fuels/</a>? </span></p>
<p><span>Harvard admits that it could easily divest from its 
directly-owned oil stocks – which account for a mere $30 million of its 
portfolio. But cleaning up its mutual funds, hedge funds, and other 
funds is more difficult. I suggest they take the easy first step – it 
sends a message, an <b>important</b> message from an <b>important</b> leader.</span></p>
<p><span>So I ask you again to Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. That too sends an <b>important</b> message from an <b>important</b>
 leader. Our money won’t do us much good if we cause great harm to the 
balanced climate on Earth. The time is NOW for bold steps.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="color: #222222;">Yesterday
 I went to a meeting of the Cambridge City Dept. to hear what the city 
employees in the Zoning Dept thought about our Net Zero Emissions Zoning
 petition. As many bureaucrats, <span>&nbsp;</span>they are hesitant to act. They say their&nbsp;<u>goal</u>
 is the same as ours: to quickly cut greenhouse gas emissions. But they 
don't think our proposal will work. On the one hand, they said if we 
require Class A REQ's, it would be too expensive for developers and they
 would build elsewhere. On the other, they said if we allow buildings to
 buy renewable energy on the open market, the cost of 10% more than 
regular energy is so cheap that it would&nbsp;<u>discourage</u>&nbsp;developers
 from making buildings more energy efficient! Frankly they can't have it
 both ways! Clearly buying renewable energy is better than doing nothing
 - and they have&nbsp;<u>no plan at all&nbsp;</u>as an alternative. So 
let's do something rather than NOTHING! I also ask you to stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline - again - a small step to combat climate change, 
but every step is important.</span></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="color: #222222;">What
 a bad idea. The short-sighted countries just want to be able to fish 
everywhere as the world fish stocks plummet. The long-sighted countries 
want to protect and conserve at least part of the world's oceans. Ocean 
conservation is hard to promote because it's hard to photograph. The 
same is true of climate conservation - But both are crucial to the 
health of the planet. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline! Stop it now.

I'm happy to read today about China's plan to improve their air quality.<br>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">

<font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><br>
The only way for China to reduce its air pollution is to&nbsp;</font></span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><u>cut back on coal</u>. "China burns half of all the coal consumed in the world." Although the plan sets modest short-term goals it is hug</font></span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">ely important because it begins the downward spiral for coal in China, and therefore&nbsp;<u>in the world</u>.
 Hooray for improving air quality and hooray for reducing greenhouse 
gases! Let's hope they replace coal with lots of renewables!</font></span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="color: #222222;">So please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline.

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="color: #222222;">I went to a rally in Harvard Yard yesterday of Harvard alums asking Harvard to divest from Big Oil in order to show&nbsp;<u>moral&nbsp;</u>leadership
 against global warming. There was a good crowd representing all ages 
and a number of pithy and witty statements. We really are living in 
extraordinary times when bold action is imperative to stop our GHG 
emissions. I wish you had been at the rally and that&nbsp;<u>you&nbsp;</u>had spoken out for&nbsp;<u>divestment</u>&nbsp;as you did earlier this year. Harvard can divest and&nbsp;<u>should</u>. You can stop the Keystone Pipeline and&nbsp;<u>should</u>.
 What excuse can you possibly have? We need to cut back quickly on our 
carbon emissions. This is serious, too serious for empty rhetoric. 
Please act now, act decisively to show your concern for global warming.</span></font></p>

now. It will get us started building the sorts of buildings we&nbsp;<u>need</u>&nbsp;for
 the next 50 years. These are big buildings so they need to be 
efficient, and they need to have as low carbon emissions as possible. 
Please take direct action against global warming and deny the permit for

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="color: #222222;">Why
 is this image so captivating? The artist captures the wagon, the horse,
 the men with some verisimilitude but the camouflaging is completely 
stylized, as is the "nature" all around them. The image is beautiful and
 quite subversive. On one level the message is that man can&nbsp;<u>control</u>&nbsp;and
 use nature to hide himself and thus have better success at hunting. But
 the idealized and decorative twigs and the orderly "nature" shows man 
as puny below the tremendous power of "real" nature. And today we should
 remember how dependent on nature and the climate we will always be. A 
bit of humility and caution would be wise! Please say NO to the Keystone

 we should be careful not to make too big a mess!</span></font></p>

 saw a wonderful documentary film yesterday called "Chasing Ice." In it 
the photographer sets up time lapse cameras on glaciers and captures

and take more wonderful dramatic shots. He shows one glacier that 
retreated 11m in 90 years and another 10m in 10 years! We are really 
changing our planet dramatically and it may have terrible effects beyond
 sea level rise. <span>&nbsp;</span>What if the jet stream changes? the

 is "Park"-ing Day and I set up an urban oasis in a parking space with 
cardboard boxes and tubes I collected from recycling bins. We quickly 
built 2 chairs and a table from cardboard boxes and at the end of the 
day we can recycle it all! We spent all day talking to people about how 
to encourage Cambridge to build net-zero emissions buildings - and 
showing them how to make furniture from cardboard boxes. It's a good way
 to engage people in how to live greener - and fun to show them how 
quick and easy it is to make cardboard strong enough to sit on. Fun for 
me, too, to be teaching young people something creative and inexpensive 
and how to RE-USE. We need to re-use the natural energy of the planet - 
the wind and sun - to enrich our lives. We need to keep oil in the

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">By restricting the amount of carbon emissions allowed you are putting a price on carbon emissions and saying COAL is<u>&nbsp;too DIRTY</u>. This is good, but we need much more. You pledged at </span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">Copenhagen</span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">
 in 2009 to reduce emissions 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. We are 
halfway there. But don't pat yourself on the back so quickly! This is a 
tiny reduction - too little too late! Every kilo of carbon that we spew 
into the air affects our climate for at least 20 years into the future. 
We are setting ourselves up for lots of climate disruptions and 
consequences we do not expect. We need to eliminate fossil fuels FASTER 
and reduce our consumption FASTER. Please say NO to the Keystone XL 
Pipeline. Show you want a <u>speedy</u> reduction in our fossil fuel use.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">Yesterday I took 
part in a "Draw the Line" Rally at the Boston Statehouse against the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. We did a bit of street theater with "villains" in 
black shirts and name tags of prominent people in Big Oil and "heroes" 
were everyone else. We performed a tug of war - and the rope slid back 
and forth across the mid-point of the Freedom Trail depending on the 
time-line events being read out. We, of course, had the heroes win - win
 against greed and self-interest. Please make our happy-ending come 
true. Please cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline. It was important for me - 
and others - that we tugged back and forth across the&nbsp;<u>Freedom Trail</u>.
 This country is based on principles of freedom from oppression - life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. There will be no happiness for 
the common man if power and greed are allowed to destroy the delicate 
balance of our climate for short-term gain.<br>

your legacy, your artwork are what you do! Please stop the Keystone XL

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">They are misguided - but perhaps the silver lining to their ploy is that more Americans may learn that the Keystone XL is&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;a

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">I
 went to an interesting meeting with my colleagues on the net-zero 
emissions building petition last evening. Our petition wants new large 
construction to&nbsp;<u>reduce&nbsp;</u>the building's needs for energy, to&nbsp;<u>produce&nbsp;</u>some renewable energy on-site, and to&nbsp;<u>purchase&nbsp;</u>local renewable energy for the rest. The "purchase" part is difficult because although you can buy 10% renewable electricity in </span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">Massachusetts</span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">, it mostly comes from REQs from </span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">Texas</span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">
 wind farms - so is not local - and the class 1 REQs that power 
companies trade are prohibitively expensive. It's hard to be green! We 
agreed to allow Green E certified energy (although probably not local) 
in the hope that increased demand for renewable energy will spur local 
renewable-energy development. You need to help increase demand for 
renewables too! Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline&nbsp;<u>TODAY!</u>&nbsp;It's urgent. Keep that dirty oil in the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">It is another 
example of dangerous practices by the oil and gas industry that cause 
untold natural disturbances. Greed - short-term profit - causes so much

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">Last week I read about the architects Skidmore and Owings, who build tall buildings and their new structural&nbsp;<u>wood</u>&nbsp;system that can be used to build as tall as 42 stories.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/science/appeal-of-timber-high-rises-widens.html?pagewanted=all"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/science/appeal-of-timber-high-rises-widens.html?pagewanted=all</span></a>&nbsp;70% of the structural system is wood - glulam - and most of the rest is concrete. The CO<sub>2</sub>
 emissions from construction materials is reduced by 70% because there 
is almost no steel. What they did not discuss is the operational CO<sub>2</sub>
 emissions and how they would differ. That would be interesting as well.
 We need to quickly cut our carbon emissions and these architects are 
looking at new ways to build to do this. You need to help us too! Please
 say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline. Say NO<u>&nbsp;now</u>!</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">I
 went to a panel discussion on net-zero buildings last evening convened 
by the Cambridge Mayor. 6 experts said it was important to reduce carbon
 emissions, but acknowledged it was difficult to do so when utility 
prices are so low. They also focused on how important it is to educate 
consumers to use less energy. Basically they pointed the fingers at 
others, and encouraged the individuals in the audience to feel guilty. 
This is baloney. My turning my computer off overnight is irrelevant 
compared to coal-fired electricity generation! So I propose that each 
group/individual do what they CAN. The city of </span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">Cambridge</span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;"> cannot pass a carbon tax, but they can&nbsp;<u>tighten their zoning</u>. They should pass the Net-Zero Emissions petition. And you&nbsp;<u>can&nbsp;</u>stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Please do it today. Yes we CAN. If we have the courage of our convictions.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">You too need to&nbsp;<u>act</u>&nbsp;on your convictions. After the IPCC report, no one can say that climate change isn't real. So now we need people to&nbsp;<u>act </u>to

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,<br>
<br>
On 19 Sept a small article describes </span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">California</span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">'s
 new transportation fuel standard that includes in the carbon emissions 
for a fuel not just what is emitted when it is used,&nbsp;<u>but also</u>&nbsp;the carbon emitted during the&nbsp;<u>production</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>transportation</u>&nbsp;of that fuel!&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/us/california-court-upholds-emissions-curbs.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/us/california-court-upholds-emissions-curbs.html</span></a>&nbsp;Of course </span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">Texas</span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;"> oil-folks sued saying it discriminated against them - and they lost! Making and using something&nbsp;<u>locally</u>&nbsp;is
 better! Clearly the Keystone XL Pipeline breaks all these rules! 
Petcoke takes more energy to extract from the ground, takes energy to 
transport in an&nbsp;<u>enormous</u>&nbsp;pipeline and takes more energy
 to export to foreign buyers. This is absolutely the wrong direction to 
be heading. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Do&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;support Canadian officials in their truly awful plans for making money. Support local renewable energy instead!<br>
<br>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;"><br>
I am happy that the Science Times tries to keep carbon emissions in the 
forefront of the news by articles on different aspects of the recent 
IPCC report that stated how much total carbon we can burn.<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/science/how-to-slice-a-global-carbon-pie.html?_r=0"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/science/how-to-slice-a-global-carbon-pie.html?_r=0</span></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">But what is truly
 depressing is reading a statement like "No American President is going 
to agree to a deal that would shut down the fossil fuel industry 15 
years from now." But this is what we need to do! Our energy companies 
need to diversify into renewables and make money from delivering energy 
across a much more robust grid. We don't have a choice. The longer it 
takes us to get going with <u>far greater</u> efforts to reduce carbon 
emissions, the harder it will be to avoid climate disaster. Please stop 
the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW. Please be the President I <u>want</u>: the President who takes significant steps to avert climate disaster.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">An entire "Energy" section in the NY Times today presents the message that oil prices will remain stable in the </span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">US</span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;"> for decades and we will benefit from cheap shale gas.&nbsp;<br>

One article claims we will still be getting 84% of our energy from thermo-electric plants in 2040.&nbsp;<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/business/energy-environment/in-a-hot-thirsty-energy-business-water-is-prized.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/business/energy-environment/in-a-hot-thirsty-energy-business-water-is-prized.html</span></a><br>
<br>
We can't afford to be doing that. We will ruin the planet! A Chevron ad 
in the section claims they (Chevron) produce "reliable, affordable 
energy." Affordable today, but ruinous (?) for tomorrow. It's all happy 
talk about business as usual. Several articles assume Canadian Tar Sands
 production will relentlessly rise. Please show leadership NOW and&nbsp;<u>stop&nbsp;</u>the Keystone XL Pipeline. Articles like these, that ignore the dangers of climate change do <b>enormous</b>
 damage, lulling complacency. But you know better. You know we must wean
 ourselves from fossil fuels. The only reliable affordable energy is 
RENEWABLE. Tell the truth. Be an&nbsp;<u>agent of change</u>. NO to Keystone. Yes to Renewables.<br>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">The article today on carbon capture projects paints a pretty bleak picture.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/science/earth/study-finds-setbacks-in-carbon-capture-projects.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/science/earth/study-finds-setbacks-in-carbon-capture-projects.html</span></a></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">The only ones that are actually operating are 3 in the </span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;">US</span><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #222222;"> that capture CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas used to&nbsp;<u>refine oil</u>&nbsp;and
 use it to stimulate the flow of oil out of old oil wells! This is 
really not going to help - because the new oil the sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> helps obtain will just emit more CO2 when&nbsp;<u>it</u>&nbsp;is
 burned. We are kidding ourselves that we are going to reduce emissions 
while we continue to pump more oil! Please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline. We must use less fossil fuel. We will ruin the habitability of
 planet earth if we don't. Please cancel KXL NOW.<br>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Oil companies in North Dakota are flaring off 29% of the natural gas they produce.<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/business/energy-environment/oil-companies-are-sued-over-natural-gas-flaring-in-north-dakota.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/business/energy-environment/oil-companies-are-sued-over-natural-gas-flaring-in-north-dakota.html</span></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">This is putting carbon into the air equivalent to 2 medium coal-fired power plants. It is <u>unconscionable</u>
 that we allow this rampant ecological harm to continue unabated. 
Clearly the "cheap" oil coming out of North Dakota isn't cheap at all. 
If the oil companies had to pay a carbon tax for every ton of carbon 
emitted from excavation, then the North Dakota oil would be&nbsp;<u>too expensive</u>&nbsp;to
 drill for! We are subsidizing their profit to the detriment of our 
children and grandchildren. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Stop 
underwriting collossal environmental damage. Protect our climate.<br>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Recently Tesoro 
Corp estimated the size of a pipeline oil spill near Tioga, North Dakota
 of 750 barrels, and later increased that estimate almost&nbsp;<u>30 times</u>&nbsp;to more than 20,000 barrels.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/north-dakota-oil-leak-is-under-scrutiny.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/north-dakota-oil-leak-is-under-scrutiny.html</span></a></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Oh gee - it was a farmer who reported the spill to the state Health Dept - not the pipeline company Tesoro! <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/us/oil-spill-in-north-dakota-raises-detection-concerns.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/us/oil-spill-in-north-dakota-raises-detection-concerns.html</a>? </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Tesoro
 should have their operation permits pulled for gross negligence. They 
didn't report to the Health Dept because they thought they wouldn't get 
caught. Not too many people live in N. Dakota - that's why they think 
it's OK to trash the environment there. Please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline - it is one more pipeline&nbsp;<u>we don't want</u>. Keep the 
oil in the ground, not spilling over the wheat fields. And by the way if
 a kid steals a t-shirt, it might be shoplifting, but 30 shirts is grand

<br>
Dear President Obama,<br>
<br>
I was disturbed by yesterday's article in the NY Times about British government support for exploratory fracking wells near </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Manchester</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The
 explanation given is that coal is "demonized" and nuclear is 
"geopolitically perilous." But what is really at issue here is what is 
most <b>profitable</b> in the short term for the energy companies. There
 is no mention here of RENEWABLE energy - wind and solar. The unstated 
subtext is that the wind and sun are free and the only profit to be made
 is in the distribution. But this is what we&nbsp;<u>must</u>&nbsp;do to
 survive! Government must nudge energy companies away from all fossil 
fuels so that they become energy distribution companies. Government must
 protect our long term interests - Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline.
 You must find the POLITICAL WILL to oppose short term reckless 
development of shale gas and other fossil fuels. Please find the 
POLITICAL WILL to keep fossil fuels underground.</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Yesterday I went to a lecture at MIT by <a href="http://www.normalesup.org/~emvincent/">Emmanuel Vincent</a>,
 a post-doc in climate science. He described his recent work on the 
relationship between cyclone events and climate variability like El 
Nino/Nina. It was quite technical, full of equations and aimed at 
academic researchers, but I enjoyed working my brain through the detail 
to better understand what we&nbsp;<u>do</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>do not</u>&nbsp;know
 about weather events and climate. There is lots we don't know and one 
of the audience was excited for the ideas of things we could measure, 
that we&nbsp;<u>don't now</u>&nbsp;measure. The take-away message is that we can't wait for&nbsp;<u>all</u>&nbsp;the
 data. We must act boldly NOW to slow GHG emissions. Please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. We must keep that oil in the ground.<br>

treatment. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW.&nbsp;<u>Face reality</u>.
 We need urgent change. Stopping the pipeline sends an important message
 that the US is serious about curbing GHG emissions. The reality is that
 every day we wait, we cause more harm to the planet.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Argentina
 gets short term cash at great expense to the environment, and the 
health of the planet. Chevron is the bad guy here - its like selling 
candy to children. Luckily people are getting better informed and 
Chevron is encountering heated resistance from Argentina's 
Environmentalists. Hooray for them. Boo to their President. Notice also 
another common thread: the drilling is in&nbsp;<u>Remote Patagonia</u>&nbsp;-
 so Chevron thought they could get away with their dirty business - 
thought people wouldn’t notice. But they are wrong. I hope Argentina

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I
 went to a Candidates Night for Cambridge City Council candidates this 
evening (while many others were watching the Red Sox win the World 
Series...). The evening was hosted by <a href="http://greencambridge.org/">Green Cambridge</a>
 and the candidates were asked about various environmental issues, both 
local and global. They had been given the questions ahead of time so 
there were no surprises. What struck me the most was that although all 
the candidates present said they supported the environment, few had 
concrete plans for action. (About 2/3 of the candidates showed up at the
 event - the others were invited but declined). So it's good politics in
 Cambridge to talk green, but far fewer are focused on <b>action</b>. So I ask you to please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW. This will show clearly that you are focused on environmental<u>&nbsp;action</u>. We urgently need to act. Please help put your energy into useful&nbsp;<u>action</u>&nbsp;to reduce carbon pollution.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I read with interest today about a Washington State ballot measure to require genetically modified foods to be labelled.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/us/vote-on-labeling-modified-food-spurs-costly-battle-in-washington-state.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/us/vote-on-labeling-modified-food-spurs-costly-battle-in-washington-state.html</span></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Big
 food and agribusiness have spent $29 million trying to defeat it! 
Opponents use the same specious arguments they used in CA - shouting 
that meat and dairy and exempted. Well&nbsp;<u>yes</u>&nbsp;- this is not about animal products, it's about&nbsp;<u>plants we grow</u>.
 I support Yes on 522 because it gives consumers more information. Big 
business can slow down these measures, but I doubt they can&nbsp;<u>stop</u>&nbsp;them. Time will tell if I am right.<br>
<br>
Specious arguments are common political tools. Big oil says it doesn't 
matter whether you allow the Keystone XL Pipeline to be built because 
Canada will keep drilling. But it&nbsp;<u>does matter</u>. It's very 
important on the World Stage for you to say NO to the Keystone XL 
Pipeline. Please do it today. We urgently need to reduce carbon 
emissions world wide. We urgently need to stop Big Oil from ruining the 
planet for us all.<br>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I read yesterday that Alberta Tar Sands crude is traveling by rail to US refineries.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/business/energy-environment/looking-for-a-way-around-keystone-xl-canadian-oil-hits-the-rails.html?pagewanted=all"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/business/energy-environment/looking-for-a-way-around-keystone-xl-canadian-oil-hits-the-rails.html?pagewanted=all</span></a></span></p>

<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I'm
 happy that the opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline and the other 
trans-Canada pipeline to British Columbia has had this result. You know,
 a pipeline can only carry oil (or gas? I don’t know) but a railway can 
carry lots of things efficiently. So when we get smart enough to stop 
mining the Tar Sands, the rail lines can be used for other things. North
 America needs more rail lines - we should have them criss crossing 
everywhere like in Europe. So please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline - 
it's a very short-sighted project - and it's dead wrong. And maybe 
Transcanada - that builds so many pipelines - can morph into building 
other infrastructures that humans can use like railroads and rail 
terminals and things I haven't even thought of. So hooray for railroads.

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">This
 piece of paper is a little rumpled because I carried around the pad all
 day, thinking I would get to writing you sooner. I first thought of 
using a fresh sheet, out of respect, but decided that it also shows 
respect that I think about you and about climate change&nbsp;<u>more than</u>&nbsp;just
 the few - or sometimes many - minutes I spend almost each day writing 
these letters. And this sheet of paper also reminds me of an expression I
 heard from a dear friend. She wrote, in a letter, that "life goes on at
 its usual raggedy pace." I’m sure that if my life seems fragmented and 
disorderly at times,&nbsp;<u>you</u>&nbsp;must feel those tensions so 
much more with all the responsibility you carry. So raggedy is OK, it's 
natural, don't beat yourself up, but&nbsp;<u>please please</u>&nbsp;find time for the important things - please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline. It's a&nbsp;<u>very important</u>&nbsp;small
 step. It will resonate, it will energize many with hope and joy for all
 the good we humans can do to pull ourselves out of this planet-wide 
climate mess and minimize the losses. Let's cut carbon emissions rapidly
 so what's usual to us in climate remains usual for&nbsp;<u>long in the future</u>.&nbsp;</span></p>

Dear President Obama,<br>
<br>
Japan is building floating wind turbines with all Japanese steel and technology.<br>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">That's good for their economy&nbsp;<u>and</u>&nbsp;their
 energy future. I learned that Japan has more coastline than the US, and
 also that they don't have a continental shell like the US, but lots 
of&nbsp;<u>pretty deep water</u>&nbsp;close to shore. This just emphasizes how we need to solve energy issues with appropriate&nbsp;<u>local</u>&nbsp;solutions.
 The wind turbine for Holland may not be identical to the one for Japan.
 Hooray to Japan for using large infrastructure projects to help their 
economy. But we have to&nbsp;<u>choose</u>&nbsp;what&nbsp;<u>infrastructure</u>.
 Japan chooses renewable energy. We need to do the same. Please say NO 
to the Keystone XL Pipeline - it is a very short term project. Please 
say YES to renewables and the infrastructure that supports them. Therein
 lies the energy FUTURE of us all.<br>

<br>
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Today
 I'll send an email to a few friends suggesting who they vote for for 
city council in Cambridge. Many many registered voters here don't vote 
in the local election - only in state and federal elections. This is a 
mistake. I find that my&nbsp;<u>one</u>&nbsp;vote doesn’t count for much
 in the big elections, but locally my vote counts much more. Here in 
Cambridge, the city council is elected by proportional representation. 
The top 9 vote-getters win. The difference between #9 who gets elected 
and #10 who does not, can be 85 votes! Now that’s where every vote 
counts.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Please
 say no to the Keystone XL Pipeline. Put your pen on the line and vote 
to stop an unneeded and wasteful pipeline. Let’s keep that awful Tars 
Sands in the ground.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The article the other day about Poland's dependency on coal for electricity was both shocking and hopeful.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/business/energy-environment/poland-wedded-to-coal-spurns-europe-on-clean-energy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/business/energy-environment/poland-wedded-to-coal-spurns-europe-on-clean-energy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0</span></a><br>
<br>
Poland&nbsp;<u>must</u>&nbsp;wean itself from coal - that is undeniable -
 it is unconscionable that 88% of their electricity comes from coal. But
 considering Poland's abysmal emission levels, this makes the EU 
emission levels look better. The other EU countries are doing all sorts 
of things to reduce their emissions, and even with Poland pulling them 
down, they do better than the US. Shame on us for not doing more!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"><br>
Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline! Stop it now! There is no 
justification for delay. This is urgent. We must set a better example in
 the world.<br>

<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I
 was happy to read on Saturday that LED light bulbs are coming down in 
price, and also that some companies like CREE are putting a priority not
 just on price, but on light&nbsp;<u>quality</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>color</u>.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/business/energy-environment/this-little-led-of-mine.html?pagewanted=all"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/business/energy-environment/this-little-led-of-mine.html?pagewanted=all</span></a></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Soon
 all the incandescent will be gone and we will get our light using a lot
 less electricity. Hooray for efficient light bulbs. But efficiency is 
not enough. We need to quickly cut our use of fossil fuels - we need to 
replace them with renewables. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Stop
 it NOW! It's&nbsp;<u>really</u>&nbsp;important for you to show your position on GHG emissions by stopping this wasteful misguided pipeline.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I was saddened to read today that Cyprus has made a deal with TOTAL of France to develop liquefied natural gas.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/business/international/cyprus-in-plan-to-develop-a-natural-gas-industry.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/business/international/cyprus-in-plan-to-develop-a-natural-gas-industry.html</span></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The
 long term strategy to drill for gas off their coast and build a 
liquefication plant comes from a need to rebuild their economy on 
something other than banking. Cyprus would be better served by 
developing wind and other renewable energies - but unfortunately the 
people willing to help out and invest are BIG OIL. Cyprus will lose 
because 20 years from now we will be cutting back on natural gas - not 
expanding its use. It is sad to see small countries pushed to develop 
unsustainable industries by large multi-national companies with only a 
short- term interest. It's like encouraging them to open a lemonade 
stand when winter is coming! Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Stop 
it now. We urgently need to wean ourselves from fossil fuels.<br>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Yesterday
 I wrote about Cyprus and a natural gas deal with France. Today it's 
Ukraine and a 50 year shale gas deal with Chevron!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/business/international/chevron-and-ukraine-sign-deal-on-shale-gas.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/business/international/chevron-and-ukraine-sign-deal-on-shale-gas.html</span></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Ukraine
 wants to be less dependent on Russia, so it's allowing Chevron to frack
 for 5 years and see what they find. With hyperbolic optimism, Ukraine 
expects to be exporting energy in 2020. That’s 6 years from now. By then
 we'll see much more clearly how fossil fuels must&nbsp;<u>stay</u>&nbsp;in
 the ground. Ukraine is letting itself be hood-winked by Chevron. Oiii! 
Even Romania and Lithuania have started opposing fracking. Chevron 
should stop bullying small weak countries- and you should show 
leadership! So please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Stop it now. Fossil
 fuels&nbsp;<u>cost too much</u>. We need to quickly switch to renewables to lessen climate damage. Show your leadership. Do the right thing.<br>

<br>
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">There was an article recently about coal plants adding some wood to lessen their carbon emissions.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/business/power-plants-try-burning-wood-with-coal-to-cut-emissions.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/business/power-plants-try-burning-wood-with-coal-to-cut-emissions.html</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">In
 places like Minnesota and Alaska that have wood product industries, 
this seems a viable option, but in Ohio where AEP tried it, the whole 
wood supply was too unpredictable. Coal has&nbsp;<u>got to go!</u>&nbsp;So
 burning waste-wood where you have a lot of it, is OK - but that is no 
long term solution. It's confusing whether burning wood is "zero carbon 
emissions" - But what's&nbsp;<u>not confusing</u>&nbsp;and is&nbsp;<u>very clear&nbsp;</u>is that our energy needs need to be met with&nbsp;<u>renewables</u>. Ditzing around with scrubbers on coal plants is ludicrous. We need to&nbsp;<u>invest dramatically</u>&nbsp;in Renewable Energy. And we need to do it quickly.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline&nbsp;<u>immediately</u>. You need to send a strong signal that our future well-being depends on reducing carbon emissions very quickly.<br>

<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The
 paper the last few days has been full of stories and pictures from 
typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, and correctly so. The Philippines 
government is estimating only a few thousand dead, but I am sure that 
number will rise much higher since many small coastal communities remain
 completely cut off and storm surges have a way of washing people out to
 sea. But today I draw your attention to another tropical storm that hit
 Somalia last weekend, killing at least 100 people, probably more, but 
obtaining only 2-3 column inches in the NY Times.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/world/africa/somalia-cyclone-kills-at-least-100.html?_r=0"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/world/africa/somalia-cyclone-kills-at-least-100.html?_r=0</span></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">We are beginning to see&nbsp;<u>multiple simultaneous</u>&nbsp;weather catastrophes. Our climate is&nbsp;<u>disrupted</u>&nbsp;and will become&nbsp;<u>less predictable</u>. It is&nbsp;<u>so</u>&nbsp;urgent
 that we quickly reduce carbon emissions. Please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline! Stop it now, and start us on a path to keeping climate chaos 
to a minimum.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">He
 is going on a hunger strike until his fellow delegates act to avert

 Sano received a standing ovation after his speech, but will anything 
change? Please show that you want&nbsp;<u>change</u>&nbsp;- that you

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">This week I went looking on the web for data on current energy consumption in the US and found&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.eia.gov/"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.eia.gov/</span></a>,
 The Energy Information Administration. They put out lots of reports on 
how much of the different fuel types we use - in different regions - 
over the past 2 decades or more and forecasts into the next several 
decades. They keep track of prices of natural gas and diesel fuel and 
lots of things month by month. They track energy use in different types 
of buildings from churches to shopping malls, from small houses to large
 apartment buildings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">It
 seems to me the primary beneficiaries of all this data collection are 
the energy industries - allowing them good data on demand - so they can 
coordinate supply for maximum profit. Perhaps not - but so it seems - 
just one more subsidy for big oil and gas. Please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline&nbsp;<u>Right Now</u>. We must stop this madness of GHG 
emissions as soon as possible. You can start today with the denial of 
the Keystone Pipeline permit.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I
 came to a dead stop on a neighborhood walk this morning when I saw a 3 
ft tall yellow bearded iris blooming in a neighbor's yard. I've never 
seen iris blooming in November - not even in California. Did it get 
confused? Did the 20 to 30 degree temperature swings back and forth make
 it think it’s spring? We are certainly living in the times of&nbsp;<u>climate disruption</u>&nbsp;that
 may reduce crop yields all over the globe. We really can't know what to
 expect. We have brought this on ourselves with carbon emissions and 
need to quickly cut those emissions! Please stop the Keystone XL

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Joe
 Nocera's column today praising the new Colorado fracking regulations 
that will lessen the amount of methane leaking combines good sense with

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Yes,
 better regulation of methane emissions today is a good thing. But a 
future where we get our energy from renewables and&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;fossil fuels is not NIRVANA, it is the only way life as we know it will survive on the planet. America&nbsp;<u>WILL</u>&nbsp;turn
 its back on natural gas - the question is WHEN, and after how much 
irreversible climate damage! Nocera's grandchildren, if he has any, 
won't thank him for this column. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. 
Stop it NOW. We urgently need to reduce GHG emissions.<br>

 well, just another exceptional weather event. These weather swings may 
not affect annual averages very much but they cause much agricultural 
damage. Crops expect steady weather and fairly constant temperatures - 
things we'll see less of in the coming decades. These startling events 
are the canaries in the coal mine for dangerous climate disruption. Are 
we listening? If we pay attention and "observe keenly" we see weather 
instability increasing everywhere. Please please please stop the

 reduce the GHG emissions. Before it's too late. Our weather patterns 
will get more unstable. Let's stop the carbon emissions NOW. Stable

generate electricity for $66 MWh is to completely disregard that the 
planet has a&nbsp;<u>finite carbon</u>&nbsp;limit/budget. To ignore this
 fact is lunacy. The EIA is using insufficient data to calculate the 
cost. Hooray to the British government for providing incentives for 
non-carbon fuels. We should be doing the same. But as a first step you

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">It's not good that the money to do so is coming from&nbsp;<u>oil</u>,
 but at least they are using their new wealth for capital expenses which
 will be useful in a post-fossil fuel world! Building a pipeline is a 
waste of money because it can only carry oil or gas. But building 
railroads shows long term wisdom! Railroads can carry anything. So 
please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline - say NO to Fossil Fuels - say
 yes to clean energy.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">A small letter last week in the NY Times by Michael Brune, the Sierra Club Executive Director deserves wider attention.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/opinion/how-a-trade-pact-could-harm-the-environment.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/opinion/how-a-trade-pact-could-harm-the-environment.html</span></a></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">He
 criticizes the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership (trade agreement) 
because it contains a little known provision that raises corporations 
to&nbsp;<u>nation status</u> and allows them to sue governments for 
environmental practices that lessen corporate profits! This is 
completely unacceptable. NO government should allow it. Corporations are
 trying to call ads "free speech" as if each were a person! And now 
corporations are trying to have legal status elevating them to avoid 
regulation! And the offending parties are, of course, big oil and 
gas!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is insanity to let short-term profit for a few ruin the world for us all.<br>

Thank you.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The NSA's document from Feb 2012 outlining their 4-year strategy could be right out of an Orwell novel!&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/us/politics/nsa-report-outlined-goals-for-more-power.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/us/politics/nsa-report-outlined-goals-for-more-power.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">They

want to aggressively pursue the legal authority to do so! Thank 
you&nbsp;<u>again</u>&nbsp;Mr. Snowden for leaking these documents. Humans can be very persistent, <span>&nbsp;</span>but
 it is a great shame that most of the time they use these skills for the
 wrong reasons. Just imagine how much we could achieve on carbon 
reduction if we were to pursue&nbsp;<u>that goal</u>&nbsp;with such&nbsp;<u>verve</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>determination</u>!
 Please say NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline. Send your statement to the

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Happy Thanksgiving. I like this holiday&nbsp;<u>especially</u>&nbsp;because it does not relate to either wars or religion. It is just a moment to reflect and be thankful. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I
 would ask you today to be thankful for the moderate climate we have 
gotten used to expecting. Unfortunately I think 10 years from now, it 
will be way less moderate. We will see all sorts of disruptions - not 
just storms, but big temperature swings, moisture swings disruptive to 
agriculture, causing human misery and wars. So please try to help us 
wreck the climate as little as possible. Please stop the Keystone XL

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">In mid-November the International Energy Agency issued its annual World Energy Outlook report.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/business/energy-environment/shales-effect-on-oil-supply-is-not-expected-to-last.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/business/energy-environment/shales-effect-on-oil-supply-is-not-expected-to-last.html</span></a></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">This group was founded by oil-importing countries in the mid 1970s in response to the Arab oil embargo. I’<a name="_GoBack"></a>m
 not sure who funds this group - whether it is governments or oil 
companies themselves, but every year they describe energy supplies and 
project out to 20 years or so expected world trends. Current projections
 go to 2035. Their assessment of world energy supplies is consistent 
with the other large data estimates made by the US EIA (Energy 
Information Administration).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">These reports say 
renewable energy currently makes up 13% of world energy supply and will 
grow to 18% by 2035. But overall energy demand will grow so carbon 
output will rise 20% over today's annual output by 2035. These 
predictions are based on:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">more people on the planet</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">more middle class + affluent people using more energy</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">some modest efficiency improvements<br>
more industrial growth to sell more stuff to people.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">These are the patterns of energy use growth over the past 70 years. But we now have a <b>carbon crisis</b>.
 If we ignore it and carry on as these professionals predict, without 
dramatic change until 2035, our chances of curtailing worldwide climate 
crisis are very slim - maybe NIL.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">We must prove these happy-talk predictions&nbsp;<u>WRONG</u>. We must move more quickly to renewable energy. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline - Stop it NOW - send a strong message.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">But
 I am also dismayed that the luxury W hotel in Taipei uses / disposes 
300,000 plastic water bottles every year. Why can't we go back to water 
filters and crystal glassware for upscale locales? The hotel’s solution 
is to design + market cool useless items like key fobs from the recycled
 plastic - but this is a short term bandaid approach. The real solution 
is to cut our GHG emissions - please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline - 
stop it today. Plastic is "cheap" because oil is "cheap" - but we need 
to stop pumping more oil - and reusing many times the plastics we 
already have. Stop that pipeline - show you care.<br>

we let ourselves be tricked into buying more and more stuff we don't 
need. And the messages to&nbsp;<u>consume more stuff</u>&nbsp;keep coming because they work! The&nbsp;<u>Use and Throw</u>&nbsp;culture
 is part of the increase in GHG emissions. Please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline. Show that you, at least, can rise above the clutter of 
messages and insist on doing the right thing. Reduce use of fossil fuels

A few cold nights per decade kept the beetles away from New Jersey up

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Today I go back to the case of Steven Donziger vs. Chevron (<a href="http://www.imaginevividly.com/Climate_Action_Letters.php#lett147">letter #147</a>).&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/business/energy-environment/lawyer-concedes-mistakes-in-chevron-case.html?pagewanted=all"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/business/energy-environment/lawyer-concedes-mistakes-in-chevron-case.html?pagewanted=all</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Chevron
 polluted the Amazon, though perhaps did not break Ecuador laws (because
 they have few). Donziger won a huge damages award for the Ecuadorean 
people. Chevron went into attack-mode and claims Donziger is a fraud and
 a cheat. But what this article on 14 Nov really proves is that it is OK
 for Chevron to "use" the Ecuador judicial system to pollute, but not OK
 for Donziger to use the same system to make them pay. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Instead
 of blackening Donziger, we need journalists to emphasize more the David
 vs. Goliath aspects of this case. Donziger is not out for personal gain
 and should be admired. Chevron has hired legions of top attorneys to 
attack the Ecuador settlement. Follow the money. Clearly Chevron is 
trying to not pay the damages. They should pay up and move on. And you 
President Obama should stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. You could be 
the&nbsp;<u>David</u>&nbsp;(the one) against the oil giants Goliath (the
 many). WE need more individual heroes today. Here is your chance. 
Please stop the pipeline today.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The shrimp are at historic lows due to overfishing and&nbsp;<u>warming sea water</u>.
 As recently as 2010, the northern shrimp harvest was worth $10 million.
 3 years later in 2013 it has shrunk more than 85% to $1.2 million. That
 is a&nbsp;<u>very rapid</u>&nbsp;decline and was enough to even scare the pro-business, pro-fishing regulators! </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Who
 knows whether the shrimp will come back and who knows what other 
ecological damage their demise causes to other sea creatures that eat 
them. The oceans are a complex web that we really know very little 
about. It is one of the scariest parts of global warming that we 
know&nbsp;<u>so&nbsp;</u>little about the oceans we really can't predict
 what's going to happen to them! Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. 
Stop it now! That is one quick fix to carbon emissions that you&nbsp;<u>can make</u>. Let's try to slow global warming so we can stand a chance of surviving it. We need to do more&nbsp;<u>NOW.</u><br>

 injustice and inequality is an increasing problem in America today and I

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">When
 Germany was faced with integrating East Germany with West, the 
government funded a huge infrastructure project of replacing windows and
 increasing the energy efficiency of old buildings. It took unemployed

to help reduce our carbon emissions quickly - so that income inequality

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Nelson
 Mandela died on Thursday and there have been many excellent articles 
about this giant of a man. I particularly liked the opinion piece by 
Charles Blow that highlighted the&nbsp;<u>confluence</u>&nbsp;of traits for which Mandela is so revered.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/opinion/a-lesson-before-dying.html?_r=0"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/opinion/a-lesson-before-dying.html?_r=0</span></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">He
 had the courage of his convictions and he fought on for what is right 
despite the US and many others considering the ANC a terrorist 
organization. There are many heroes we admire from Greek tragedies to 
John Wayne movies - but most of them seek to maintain a system of values
 - and many are overtaken by a changing world.<br>
<br>
What makes Mandela so special is that he combined his bravery with his&nbsp;<u>imagination</u>&nbsp;of a better world to promote real and sustained&nbsp;<u>change</u>.
 As Charles Blow writes: "Those who can't imagine change reveal the 
deficits of their imaginations, not the difficulty of change."</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">And the third of Mandela's strengths is the one that we should perhaps admire the most, and that is his&nbsp;<u>grace</u>,
 his ability to forgive and to foster long term reconciliation. It is 
this trait that moves human societies beyond tribalism, beyond revenge, 
beyond the corrosive divisions of me/you, winner/loser, my good 
religion/ all other bad religions, my right answer / your wrong answer.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">So
 I graciously voice my respect for your fight for social and economic 
justice for all. Those are indeed worthy causes. But if climate change 
causes millions of mostly poor people to die because we took too long to
 change our ways, that is certainly not justice. So please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline - as an important and visible step to speed up our 
change to renewable energy. Stop the pipeline while you also continue to
 try to increase economic opportunities for all.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I
 wrote yesterday about Nelson Mandela, his courage, his persistence, his
 ability to imagine a better world, and his graciousness and efforts at 
reconciliation that I hope will continue to inspire people for 
generations to come. In writing that letter, I reflected back on my 
first 3 letters to you last March in which I recommended that you&nbsp;<u>observe</u>&nbsp;keenly,&nbsp;<u>reason</u>&nbsp;soundly, and&nbsp;<u>imagine<i>&nbsp;</i></u>vividly.
 That advice from Charles Eliot still rings true and I'm glad to have 
started my letters from those wise words. But upon reflection, Mandela 
did all of that and more. Eliot's advice can be followed by anyone, 
anywhere, even all alone. But graciousness, and reconciliation are&nbsp;<u>social acts</u>&nbsp;that
 move people forward past trauma, past hatred, past tribalism. To combat
 climate change we are going to have to put aside our differences and 
act mostly together. Mandela showed us the path, showed us that 
our&nbsp;<u>social</u>&nbsp;strengths make us even more powerful than our individual ones. So as the leader of this great&nbsp;<u>society</u>,
 I ask you to please stop the Keystone Pipeline because leadership is 
about acting for the greater good - about nudging societies to do what 
is better for all - about promoting beneficial change. Please pick up 
that pen. It may be more important that you think.<br>

 small stories in the paper yesterday caught my eye: A severe ice storm

 Pilot whales off the Florida coast are headed back to shallow waters 
where 11 of their group died a few days ago. They are presumed ill since
 they cannot survive in shallow waters. Changes that are sudden and 
unexpected in weather can cause great harm. And who knows what changes 
to the oceans are contributing to the fatal whale behavior. The climate 
is more and more disrupted - the patterns of decades and centuries are 
suddenly changing. We ignore these signs at our peril. And these climate
 disruptions are probably&nbsp;<u>small</u>&nbsp;compared to what we 
will experience 10 years from now as the CO2 emissions rise even further
 and the planet warms. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. We need to 
urgently lessen carbon emissions. Fossil fuels need to stay in the 
ground. Our climate is in danger and sending us warning signals - we 
need to observe these signs keenly and act quickly and decisively to 
prevent further harm.<br>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I
 was happy to read the other day that the 5 major oil companies and 
another 20 or so big coporations are making long term plans based on 
paying a&nbsp;<u>$60 per ton</u>&nbsp;carbon tax.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/business/energy-environment/large-companies-prepared-to-pay-price-on-carbon.html?pagewanted=all"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/business/energy-environment/large-companies-prepared-to-pay-price-on-carbon.html?pagewanted=all</span></a>&nbsp;This
 will make it easier to start such a tax - which is long overdue. But 
I've also got to say that if they are planning for $60 per ton, then the
 tax should probably be $120 per ton! These are some of the most 
profitable business in the country that have made their profits by&nbsp;<u>not paying the true</u>&nbsp;cost
 of the environmental damage they have caused. Let's quickly implement a
 carbon tax and let's set the bar high to make up for all the years of 
artificially "cheap" oil and gas. These fossil fuels are&nbsp;<u>NOT CHEAP!</u>&nbsp;They cause enormous climate disruptions and will continue to do so for decades&nbsp;<u>after</u>&nbsp;we
 stop burning them! Set a $60 per ton carbon tax that automatically 
doubles to $120 per ton 4 years later! Now there's a good idea. And 
meanwhile stop the Keystone XL Pipeline to show you are serious about 
combatting climate change.<br>

 They pump oil, refine it, get some gas, use it locally, use some of the
 oil, and export the rest. Oil is liquid, so much easier to export than 
gas. Now that we have the technology to make LNG, BP has convinced Oman 
there is an export market. Long term, the world will have to abandon

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Merry Christmas! <span>&nbsp;</span>here is a photo so you can put a face to all these letters! Please STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline. Do it&nbsp;<u>really</u>&nbsp;soon.
 It is URGENT that we cut back rapidly on our carbon emissions. Please 
stop the Keystone XL and send an important message that you understand 
how huge a problem climate change will pose to future generations!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">After a little 
break, I am back to writing you letters. On 28 Dec I was dismayed at an 
article on how difficult it is for nuclear and renewables to compete in 
the current electricity market where natural gas is "so cheap."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/new-energy-struggles-on-its-way-to-markets.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/new-energy-struggles-on-its-way-to-markets.html</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">In 2012 "production
 of electricity from natural gas rose 10 times as fast as production 
from wind." This is catastrophic for the climate and many millions of 
people. It is unconscionable that you and other leaders stand by and 
allow the oil and gas multinationals to cause such long term damage 
without doing&nbsp;<u>everything you can</u>. You can stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today. Please do it! Do it now! We urgently need to put an appropriate&nbsp;<u>very high</u>&nbsp;price on carbon emissions. Waiting for the markets to regulate themselves is not acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">On 27 Nov there was an interesting opinion piece by Debora Cramer on horseshoe crabs and red knot birds.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/opinion/a-bird-whose-life-depends-on-a-crab.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/opinion/a-bird-whose-life-depends-on-a-crab.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The birds eat the 
crab eggs and we use horseshoe crab blood to test for bacterial 
contamination in a range of drugs and medical devices. We also catch 
crabs to use as bait, and have harvested too many - so now the number of
 spring red knots in Delaware Bay is down 70 percent. The red knots 
breed in the Arctic - their breeding grounds are changing - the 
increased CO2 in the oceans is stunting the growth of tiny clams and 
mussels that crabs and shore birds eat. The problems of the red knots 
are primarily caused by&nbsp;<u>climate change</u>. Here is just one more scientist calling for&nbsp;<u>aggressive</u>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">reduction in 
greenhouse gases. Please listen to these scientists. Please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline today. Make it a first step along an urgent 
decrease in our use of fossil fuels.</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Because the Federal
 government and the Canadian government are so woefully sluggish and 
timid in addressing greenhouse gas emissions, British Columbia, 
California, Oregon, and Washington have joined together to form 
the&nbsp;<u>Pacific Coast Action Plan on Climate and Energy.</u>&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/opinion/a-new-alliance-on-climate-change.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/opinion/a-new-alliance-on-climate-change.html</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">They are trying to 
speed up use of renewable energy and link their carbon-pricing plans 
(putting pressure on Oregon and Washington to&nbsp;<u>pass</u>&nbsp;carbon-pricing
 as California and BC have done). These 4 entities have a population of 
more than 50 million and a huge economy. They see climate change as 
an&nbsp;<u>economic opportunity</u>&nbsp;and I wish them well in getting
 out in front of the issues. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Stop 
it today. Show you too are serious about reducing GHG emissions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I wrote yesterday praising the Pacific Coast Action Plan. I must say, part of the reason they drew up that plan is the&nbsp;<u>completely wimpy</u>&nbsp;executive
 order in early Nov encouraging greater attention to climate change, and
 the White House "task force" to offer advice" The NY Times article (1 
Nov) describing those steps reminds us that&nbsp;<u>YOU</u>&nbsp;have said you will use your administrative powers "to take the strongest actions [you] can on climate change."&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/science/earth/white-house-will-focus-on-climate-shifts-while-trying-to-cut-greenhouse-gases.html?_r=0"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/science/earth/white-house-will-focus-on-climate-shifts-while-trying-to-cut-greenhouse-gases.html?_r=0</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">So please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline today. Every day we put off reducing carbon 
emissions, we create more dangerous conditions for future generations. 
Please act now and show the world how urgent a problem climate change 
is!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I just received a 
note from a 96 year old friend whose handwriting is still firm - telling
 me of her recent visit to the pueblos at </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Taos</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">, </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">New Mexico</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"> to see some native American celebrations. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">These simple and 
beautiful ceremonies have been performed by countless generations with a
 spirit of unity with the natural world. We need to learn from them and 
curb our fossil fuel use before we wreak irreversible damage on the 
climate of the entire planet. When the Europeans arrived on this 
continent they were certain they were more civilized - but I wonder if 
that is true. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline - we don't need the 
dirty oil - so should just leave it in the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I'm pleased that the TPP - Trans-Pacific Partnership has stalled.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/business/international/no-pacific-rim-accord-by-end-of-year-target-trade-negotiators-say.html?pagewanted=all"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/business/international/no-pacific-rim-accord-by-end-of-year-target-trade-negotiators-say.html?pagewanted=all</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">It is a poorly constructed agreement that gives all together too much power to&nbsp;<u>corporations</u>.
 If you are serious about closing the opportunity-gap in America, then 
you recognize how corporations have hugely prospered in the last couple 
of decades&nbsp;<u>at the expense</u>&nbsp;of workers. This is one cause
 of the huge income disparity between rich and poor. Corporations need 
less power, not more! When corporations have too much power, they make 
decisions based solely on short-term profit. Another example of this is 
the Keystone XL Pipeline - which does not provide North America with oil
 it needs, but only facilitates exporting oil to Asia for profit. Please
 stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Stop it NOW. We&nbsp;<u>must curb</u>&nbsp;GHG emissions very quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Dr. James Overland 
of NOAA has noticed that these shifts in very cold air have become more 
common in the last five years, and suggest they have something to do 
with the melting arctic sea ice. Others disagree, but we cannot wait for
 definitive answers on climate change before acting. That's because the 
planet will continue to warm for 20 years&nbsp;<u>after</u>&nbsp;we stop
 spewing carbon into the air at greater and greater rates! Please stop 
the Keystone XL Pipeline. Stop it today. It's completely unnecessary and
 that oil needs to stay in the ground. Dr. Overland is&nbsp;<u>yet another</u>&nbsp;scientist
 who is warning us to take dramatic action NOW. Wild temperature surges 
will get more common. These winter ones are manageable, but wild swings 
in spring can cause great crop loss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I was happy to see the NY times long editorial supporting Edward Snowden on 2 January.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/opinion/edward-snowden-whistle-blower.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/opinion/edward-snowden-whistle-blower.html</span></a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">He is certainly a 
hero of 2013 and deserves much better treatment for his important 
actions. My only sadness at reading the piece is that&nbsp;<u>climate change</u>&nbsp;does not figure as prominently as a problem we <b>urgently</b>
 need to address. The thing of it is, that if we really mess up the 
weather patterns and destabilize the tradewinds and ocean currents, the 
impact on world food supplies could be catastrophic, and by the time the
 definitive scientific conclusions are in, there will be little left to 
do to rectify things. We need brisk preventive action NOW. Please stop 
the Keystone XL Pipeline! Please stop it today. Your bold action&nbsp;<u>against</u>&nbsp;climate
 change can dramatically advance the speedy reduction of carbon 
emissions. If we don't reduce carbon emissions quickly enough, our 
efforts at social economic justice will be in vain. Step back. Look at 
the big picture. Get it right!</span></p>

Because </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">China</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"> is so powerful, few countries wanted to accept them.

 What language do they speak in these new homes far from the Central 
Asian Steppes? Much of their conflict with the Chinese has been over 
natural resources and their nomadic way of life. The Chinese want 
Xinjiang for its minerals, don't care about the environment or its 
indigenous peoples. And so in honor of these Uighurs, I ask you to&nbsp;<u>stop</u>&nbsp;the
 Keystone XL Pipeline. Do what you can to protect land for those who 
live lightly on it - and take a stance against the awful environmental

up front, regardless of how many wells they drilled, and expected to 
collect a clean-up fee as each well was closed. But the companies have

Late December brought yet another article about wind power companies 
scrambling to begin projects in 2013 so they can qualify for the 2.3

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Without
 this tax credit, wind farms cannot compete with "cheap natural gas." 
Wind farms are the future. Fossil fuels are the past. Natural gas 
is&nbsp;<u>not cheap</u>&nbsp;when you count the cost of universal 
carbon emissions. When will enough people in government recognize the 
carbon emissions problem for the&nbsp;<u>urgent crisis</u>&nbsp;it is? 
Only then will markets be regulated to ensure the long-term health of 
Planet Earth. We cannot continue to let short term greed endanger the 
welfare of future generations everywhere. The whole discussion of power 
costs is skewed. Let's tax carbon emissions - then&nbsp;<u>clean wind</u>&nbsp;wouldn't
 need a "subsidy." Please please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline - we need
 to dramatically change the energy dialogue - one way to do this is 
for&nbsp;<u>you</u>&nbsp;President Obama to demonstrate your commitment to quickly reduce carbon emissions. Please do it now.<br>

I write today about efforts by SGB a biofuels company to hybridize jatropha to produce&nbsp;<u>ten</u>&nbsp;times
 as many seeds per plant - so that its oil can be turned into low-carbon
 jet fuel. SGB plans to plant over 200,000 acres of jatropha in </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Brazil</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">, </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">India</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">, and other warm climates - eventually.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">But
 what bio-diverse ecosystem will they replace with their monoculture? 
What unforseen unintended consequences will they incur? The plans seem 
imbued with equal parts hubris and colonialism - the rich are going to 
plant huge swaths of land in poor areas with a crop they can export for 
use by the rich - sounds like just another resource-grab. If we are 
going to succeed in reducing our global carbon use, we need to respect 
each other and the planet's biodiversity. Please stop the Keystone XL

than a production-based measure.<br>

<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">That's because the US and </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Europe</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"> consume lots of products that are produced in </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">China</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">
 and other developing countries. Mr. Porter is correct, but the real 
problem is that no one seems to sense the urgency of the carbon build up
 and so we just carry on with our own local agendas. I hope that 2014 
will bring some breakthroughs in understanding by&nbsp;<u>key world leaders</u>&nbsp;that
 we need to address carbon emissions urgently. I hope you are one of 
those world leaders! Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW as a small

 Governments are "still spending far more money to subsidize fossil

disruption" and "vast ecological and economic damage" and "an

 It is pointless to try to level income inequality if we don't stop

 This is money well spent. Far better than $100 million for BECC-biomass
 carbon capture! We need to include nuclear energy in our mix if we are 
to avert climate disaster, and these ideas for small transportable 
nuclear plants look promising. We need to spend much more on new&nbsp;<u>clean energy</u>&nbsp;ideas
 and much less subsidizing fossil fuels. Please say NO to the Keystone 
XL Pipeline. Please show you are serious about moving quickly&nbsp;<u>AWAY</u>&nbsp;from fossil fuels and&nbsp;<u>towards</u>&nbsp;a clean energy future.</span></p>

 I hear again parts of his famous speeches. His actions, his moral 
courage, his words, would have less impact, would reverberate less 
through history if he mumbled, or hurried his words. Still today, we 
respond emotionally to Dr. King's speeches - and&nbsp;<u>emotion</u>&nbsp;puts us right&nbsp;<u>in the moment</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>goads action</u>. We need great leaders to tap into that emotion to&nbsp;<u>build</u>&nbsp;a
 movement. I ask you again today to please STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline
 because it will inspire the climate movement and give it strength. Your
 small pen stroke can put&nbsp;<u>emotion</u>&nbsp;and leadership behind
 climate activists. The planet needs you, we need you, the poor all over
 the world need you. Please lead us towards quickly reducing carbon

 sub-title of the conference says it all: "Committed to improving the

 matter. So the conference is heavy with heads of states of lesser 
countries and bankers and public sector people from wealthy ones. It's 
an interesting club and some useful work gets done there, but the 
inspiring speeches are preaching to the choir, rather than changing 
minds. Maybe actions speak louder than words. So please STOP the 
Keystone XL Pipeline and by this&nbsp;<u>action</u>&nbsp;show how serious you are about the climate change crisis. Your action&nbsp;<u>could</u>&nbsp;change minds,&nbsp;<u>could</u>&nbsp;elevate

 means the reservoirs will be empty next summer. The trade winds are

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was happy to read recently that the largest oil companies are selling off many assets: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/business/international/shell-to-sell-stake-in-australian-gas-field.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/business/international/shell-to-sell-stake-in-australian-gas-field.html?_r=0</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Shell is selling their interest in an Australian LNG project to </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Kuwait</span><span style="font-family: arial;">, ENI sold its </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Mozambique</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> stake last year. In recent years the biggest global oil companies have invested so much in new projects that their profits are <u>way down</u>. The smartest of these companies are selling off the fossil fuel projects with the <b>longest lead times</b>
 because they see that the world is changing and carbon taxes loom on 
the horizon. The climate has changed, people are noticing, and Big Oil 
is cutting its losses. This is great news. So please do your part! 
Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW! It is another Big Dirty Oil 
project the world does not need. Do us all a favor. Thank you.</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I write to you today about two 
recent articles about rail safety rules that need urgent and immediate 
updating due to the surge of transport of Bakken and Tar Sands crude oil
 by RAIL. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/business/us-and-canada-urge-new-safety-rules-for-crude-oil-rail-shipments.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/business/us-and-canada-urge-new-safety-rules-for-crude-oil-rail-shipments.html</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Two-thirds of the one-million 
barrels a day of Bakken production goes by rail. It travels on DOT 111 
freight cars that were designed for milk, corn syrup, vegetable oil, NOT
 flammable liquids. NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman says “this is a huge
 change in what is being transported.” Until we get safer cars the only 
safe thing to do is SHORTER TRAINS, SLOWER SPEED. We need to SLOW the 
FLOW of this TOXIC FLAMMABLE DIRTY OIL. <span style="color: #222222;">Please
 stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today! No more pipelines, shorter trains,
 let’s limit the flow of fossil fuels across our lands. We are addicted 
to fossil fuels and need to cut back. We need to start addressing our 
addiction. Thank you.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In 2012 the Biggert-Waters (could be Bigg<b>es</b>t-Waters
 ...) Flood Insurance Act shifted the financial risk of flood insurance 
from the federal govt to homeowners. FEMA updated many of their maps and
 insurance costs soared 700 to 800% in many places in a single year. 
That’s because those houses will probably flood. Insurance companies 
first <b>do the math</b>. Postponing the Biggert-Waters increases for 4 years achieves nothing but government subsidy to unsafe houses. We all need to <b>do the math!</b> The costs of global warming are going to be huge. The best way to keep them down is to cut carbon emissions URGENTLY! <span style="color: #222222;">Please

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Recently I saw a very good documentary film “<a href="http://www.thecarbonrush.net/">Carbon Rush</a>.” It’s about the various projects undertaken in 3<sup>rd</sup> world countries that are supposedly carbon <u>negative</u>, and so provide carbon <u>credits</u> to offset carbon emissions elsewhere. This <b>carbon offset market</b>
 came about because the EU wanted very badly to decrease their effective
 emissions. The intention was entirely honorable, but without extensive 
oversight many of these projects have had disastrous effects on local 
populations. Huge eucalyptus plantations take water from local farmers, 
burning trash in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">India</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> takes jobs away from efficient local trash pickers. Instead, we all need to find LOCAL solutions. <span style="color: #222222;">Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY. and please try to pass a <b>carbon tax</b>
 – that money stays LOCAL! Not every carbon-reducing project works and 
carbon offsets tend to encourage abuse. They need better oversight. 
Thank you.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I am ashamed to be 
an American when I read that Atty. General Eric Holder has authorized 
the Justice Dept. to seek the death penalty against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 
the </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Boston</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"> marathon bomber. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Both Mr. Holder and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh <b>say</b>
 they personally oppose the death penalty, but support the barbaric 
decision. They are hypocrites, You can’t have it both ways. The </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Marathon</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">
 bombing was a horrendous act, but killing a 19 year old in retribution 
does not make our country safer. Postponing urgent action to reduce 
carbon emissions doesn’t make the world safer either. Please act NOW. 
Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Climate disruption will lead to many 
regional conflicts and possibly violence. Getting off fossil fuels will 
minimize that conflict and violence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The monarch butterflies’ numbers have again precipitously declined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/us/monarch-butterflies-falter-under-extreme-weather.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/us/monarch-butterflies-falter-under-extreme-weather.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This winter in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Mexico</span><span style="font-family: arial;">
 they inhabit only 1.65 acres. Last winter it was about 3.2 acres, which
 was a recod low from previous years, and in 1996 the covered 45 acres. 
Their numbers have dropped 97 percent in 17 years! They are victims of 
Roundup-managed monoculture that has wiped out milk weed, the misguided 
government ethanol program, and weather disruptions in spring: too hot 
one year, too cold the next. All three are caused by human FOLLY, either
 greed or carbon pollution. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW. 
Carbon pollution is going to wipe out the monarchs with climate 
instability and will have disastrous effect on <b>human</b> populations <b>too</b>. We must cut out carbon emissions. Learn from the monarchs before it is too late – and before they are GONE.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I am appalled at the State<span>&nbsp; </span>Dept. for their report on the Keystone XL Pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/us/politics/report-may-ease-way-to-approval-of-keystone-pipeline.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/us/politics/report-may-ease-way-to-approval-of-keystone-pipeline.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>&nbsp;</span>To say that the 
pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution because without
 it the oil would still be pumped at the same rate is an unconscionable 
lie. If your kid says to you they are spending a fortune on a faster 
sports car, but they won’t drive any faster, you don’t believe it.<span>&nbsp; </span>If
 a company says they’re spending a fortune on a pipeline that won’t make
 them richer, you shouldn’t believe it either. So just say NO to the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">When the world comes to its senses 
and the price of fossil fuels is too high, we can still use the 
railroads to transport other goods. That pipeline could only transport 
oil. Call their bluff. If the pipeline won’t make a difference, say NO 
to it. They say they don’t need it. So say they can’t build it!</span></p>

 recommend that the President DENY the pipeline permit. Carbon pollution
 is a global crisis with huge humanitarian implications. The poor and

 The quicker we stop, the less damage to the planet. There is only one 
intelligent and moral recommendation. Please say NO to the KXL pipeline.
 The immediate effect will not be huge, but a long train has a long 
braking distance. Let’s start putting on the brakes.</span></font></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">David Bonior is right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/opinion/obamas-free-trade-conundrum.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/opinion/obamas-free-trade-conundrum.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">You can’t have it both ways. Fast-track for the TPP trade pact means some cheaper imported goods, but will <b>greatly exacerbate</b> income inequality in the </span><span style="font-family: arial;">US</span><span style="font-family: arial;">. It’s about <b>gutting</b>
 the middle class so big corporations can be more profitable. Harry Reid
 is right! I commend his staunch opposition to Fast-track trade pact 
approval. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Shame on you. You say income 
inequality is your signature issue! Then act that was and quit pushing 
TPP. Why don’t you focus on clean energy? Lots of jobs can be created 
there and in retro-fitting for energy efficiency. Please say NO to the 
Keystone XL Pipeline! It will only creast a few temporary construction 
jobs and cause lots of environmental damage. Your role as President is 
to <b>Reason soundly</b> and make good choices that benefit <b>all</b> Americans. Stop being blind-sided by smooth-talking lobbyists. TPP and KXL both need to be stopped. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was also thrilled that he mentioned <b>climate change</b>
 as one of the big problems in the world along with racism and violence.
 He spoke of the collaborative nature of jazz and its basis in <b>generosity</b>.
 He encouraged us to work together more. And so in his honor, I ask you 
to please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline because it is disastrous for the
 climate and future generations. This is the <b>maiden voyage </b>of 
Planet Earth and our only voyage. We won’t get a second chance. So let’s
 not mess up the planet irreversibly. I’ll listen to Hancock’s album <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_Voyage_(Herbie_Hancock_album)">Maiden Voyage</a></u>
 tonight, and hope you do too. And I hope the beauty inspires you to act
 urgently to avert the worst of climate change. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was heartening to read the 25 
January NYTimes article that the fight against the Keystone XL Pipeline 
has brought many small donations of time and money to environmental 
groups such as 350.org. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I am thrilled to be one of the 250,000 <b>new</b>
 350.org members since 2011. I am also thrilled that our ranks of 
activists are described as “deployable and passionate.” But make no 
mistake, it is not the pipeline that has <b>fueled</b> this upswelling of environmentalists, it is the colossal climate <b>damage</b>.
 We yell about KXL to get your attention and media attention. But we 
well know the breadth of the problems, from coal, from fracking, from 
“cheap” gas. We are the tip of a huge iceberg. For every activist there 
are dozens who are less visible and vocal. Climate crisis is the most 
important problem facing the world TODAY. If we destroy our balanced 
climate, nothing else matters much. Our convictions run deep. We will 
fight on. So please join us sooner rather than later. Please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The oil drillers in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">North Dakota</span><span style="font-family: arial;">
 have made their own task force that has decided they should increase 
the percent of gas they capture from 70 % this year to 85 % in 2016 and 
“almost all” by 2020. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Gee! I’m <b>not</b> impressed! They
 are making so much money and flaring off so much gas that goes directly
 into the atmosphere, that they think they can do better!! It is

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I write today in honor of Dr. Abbas Khan, 32 years, who was tortured and killed in a Syrian government prison. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/db0b362b25579020b456da0f022dc4ac.jpg" width="392" height="261"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">His crime was treating Syrians in rebel-held areas. Dr. Khan was raised in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Britain</span><span style="font-family: arial;">, he was a Sunni Muslim, one of his sisters was a Shiite Muslim. His parents were self-made Indian immigrants to </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Britain</span><span style="font-family: arial;">
 who urged their children not to forget their modest roots. This family 
shows no evidence of terrorist tendencies. As his brother says: “in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Syria</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> we were too British, in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Britain</span><span style="font-family: arial;">
 we were too Indian.” This is a tragic story of someone giving back to 
society and being killed for it. One official told his mother that with 
an Indian passport he may not have been killed! How barbaric the world 
still is. As climate disruption continues, these barbaric wars will only

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Years ago I sent this card to my 
mother on her birthday, saying “May your years sit as lightly as those 
on this rug.” Your legacy will only sit lightly on future generations if
 you stop the Keystone XL Pipeline! Please do it today! So the world can
 still be beautiful in another 300 years. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was pleased to read recently that a Federal Appeals Court <u>upheld</u> the recent multi-billion dollar settlement against British Petroleum for damages in the 2010 </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Horizon</span> <span style="font-family: arial;">Gulf</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> oil spill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/business/energy-environment/appeals-court-upholds-oil-spill-settlement.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/business/energy-environment/appeals-court-upholds-oil-spill-settlement.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Judge Carl Barbier made the settlement ruling in 2012, and the 5<sup>th</sup>
 circuit court upheld it, 2 to 1. “Today’s ruling is an enormous victory
 for the Gulf” and class-action claimants. The ruling comes despite a 
slew of ads by BP recently claiming that the ruling was completely 
unfair. Hooray for Judge Barbier and hooray to the courts who can’t be 
bought off by Big Oil! Big Oil needs to stop pushing their weight 
around. The tide is turning against them. Please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline NOW! Show your concern for impending worldwide climate 
disruption.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I brought my cousin to </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Paris</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> with me for a vacation and I have been very busy showing her around and translating for her.

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I loved the story of the villagers of Imider, </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Morocco</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> who have been occupying a hilltop where they closed off some of the water supply to the Imider Mettalurgic Silvermine below. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/world/africa/on-moroccan-hill-villagers-make-stand-against-a-mine.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/world/africa/on-moroccan-hill-villagers-make-stand-against-a-mine.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">They say the mine takes the silver 
and leaves them the waste, that it uses too much water and provides very
 few jobs. Congratulations to them for regaining a portion of this water
 supply for their crops, their fruit trees. The meet regularly and after
 each meeting walk home “holding up 3 fingers, one for the Berber 
language, one for the land, and one for mankind.” In honor of these 
Berbers and their land stewardship, please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline. Climate disruption will cause huge damage across the world. 
Please show you understand how quickly we need to stop using fossil 
fuels. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I’ve just spent 10 days in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Paris</span><span style="font-family: arial;">
 at friends’ and now am in the airport bus on my way home. There are 
puffy clouds in the sky and the buildings are magnificent, the doorways,
 the balconies, the view down little side streets. The French are good 
at balance, big and small, grand and less grand, serious and playful. 
This Picasso postcard captures this ability, this capacity for joy and 
multitasking. I know that you are busy with many things, but I still ask
 you to think of the health of the planet and to please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. It is really important to start reducing carbon 
emissions RAPIDLY! So please do it today. Maybe you will have denied the
 pipeline permit before I step off the plane. That would be great!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was very happy to read about Tom Steyer’s Super PAC Next Gen Climate and his efforts to get more climate <u>realists</u> elected. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/us/politics/financier-plans-big-ad-campaign-on-environment.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/us/politics/financier-plans-big-ad-campaign-on-environment.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">As he so clearly states, “ climate change is the <u>generational challenge</u>
 of the world.” If we get this wrong, the world will be a far less 
hospitable place for humans. Mr. Steyer is a realist. His timeline for 
reducing carbon emissions is much <u>shorter</u> than yours. Please stop
 the Keystone XL Pipeline today! We need to immediately change our 
dependence on fossil fuels. It is unfortunate that climate change has 
become so politicized, as it will affect us all, across all lines of 
parties, races, religions. Please show your leadership and your concern 
for the Next Generation and reinvigorate your actions to protect the 
climate. Your new guidelines for truck emissions are too little too 
late. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">(2<sup>nd</sup> letter today)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was happy to read recently of the
 17 foundations controlling $1.8 billion in investments who have decided
 to divest their portfolios from fossil fuels because it makes economic 
sense. <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/foundations-band-together-to-get-rid-of-fossil-fuel-investments/">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/foundations-band-together-to-get-rid-of-fossil-fuel-investments/</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">They are forward-thinking and 
savvy. Less admirable is Drew Faust, Pres. of Harvard, who talks out of 
both sides of her mouth! On the one hand she insists that universities 
own so little, that selling the fossil fuel investments would have 
“negligible financial impact” on the companies. On the other, she wants 
to keep shares so as not to diminish Harvard’s voice! You can’t have it 
both ways. Pres. Faust is misguided. Harvard should divest. They can 
make plenty of money elsewhere. You too are misguided if you think the 
Keystone XL Pipeline doesn’t matter. It does! Please deny it today. Make
 it harder for </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Canada</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> to swamp </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Asia</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> with its dirty oil.

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Hooray to Judge Stephanie F. Stacy of the Third Judicial District Court of </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Nebraska</span><span style="font-family: arial;">. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/us/nebraska-judge-blocks-pipeline-route.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/us/nebraska-judge-blocks-pipeline-route.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This principled judge blocked the Keystone XL Pipeline’s traversal of </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Nebraska</span><span style="font-family: arial;">, ruling that Gov. Dave Heineman’s approval of the pipeline was unconstitutional. </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Nebraska</span><span style="font-family: arial;">
 is not a state known for extremist firebrands. Judge Stacy is the voice
 of reason. The governor does not have the right to inflict this 
environmental calamity on </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Nebraska</span><span style="font-family: arial;">. You could end this mess right now, by denying the Keystone XL Pipeline. Please do so immediately. We must discourage </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Canada</span><span style="font-family: arial;">
 from pumping their dirty oil. The carbon emissions are detrimental to 
the entire world. Thank you to Judge Stacy. Please follow her excellent 
and commendable action. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I am very glad you welcomed the Dalai Lama at the White House yesterday. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/world/asia/us-brushes-off-chinese-rebuke-as-obama-meets-with-dalai-lama.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/world/asia/us-brushes-off-chinese-rebuke-as-obama-meets-with-dalai-lama.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">And I am happy that he does most of
 the talking at these meetings. He is a wise and humble man with a broad
 view of human issues from whom we could all learn a lot. I’ve only seen
 him speak once and his quiet energy and heartfelt joyous laugh made a 
profound impact. I am sure you felt reinvigorated and hopeful after 
seeing him, as I did only seeing him from a crowd. I cannot think of a 
more universal value than protecting the climate of our beautiful and 
hospitable planet for all humanity and future generations. But these 
tiny baby steps of gradual reductions will prove disastrous and will 
gravely tarnish your legacy as President. Fresh from your meeting with 
the Dalai Lama, please act decisively with hope and conviction to start 
the </span><span style="font-family: arial;">US</span><span style="font-family: arial;">
 on a much steeper reduction of carbon emissions. Please say NO to the 
Keystone XL Pipeline to start us on our way. We will continue to 
experience climate disruptions for decades <u>after</u> we wean ourselves from fossil fuels. Please act quickly now to minimize the damage. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Today is my 50-something-th 
birthday. The last 10 years have been mostly good to me. I am healthy, 
wealthy, and if not wise, well a bit less hampered by anger and 
mind-numbing stresses. I am largely happy with who I am and just wish my
 sphere of influence were larger, so that I could personally do more to 
combat and avert the worst effects of climate disruption that are 
bearing down on us all. Most of the country is still locked in a drowsy 
slumber – pushing that snooze button on the alarm clock and snuggling 
into the pillows again before having to face reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">But the reality of climate disruption will be <u>grim</u>,
 and the next 10 years will not be nearly as pleasant as the last. The 
time for quick and urgent action is NOW (or yesterday would have been 
even better!) Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline Right NOW. Pick up 
that pen! Switching from coal to gas over the next 35 years is not 
nearly enough! We need to dramatically reduce carbon emissions over the 
next 10 years! Even that is too slow. <br>
At least I can tell my children that I am doing what I can. Can you say 
the same? Please stop that KXL Pipeline as a first small step. Thank 
you.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 321</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>Footprint Power has obtained permission to build a large gas-fired power plant to replace the old </span><span>Salem</span> <span>MA</span><span> coal-fired plant. The Conservation Law Foundation tried to slow them down, and it is the first power plant in the </span><span>US</span><span> scheduled to be shut down as part of its permitting. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/business/energy-environment/massachusetts-approves-a-gas-power-plant-with-an-expiration-date.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/business/energy-environment/massachusetts-approves-a-gas-power-plant-with-an-expiration-date.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>But unfortunately, the new gas-fired plant will emit 4 times the CO2 every year than the current </span><span>Salem</span><span> coal plant emits now.<span>&nbsp; </span>And it will do so for the next 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.commonwealthmagazine.org/Voices/Back-Story/2014/Winter/006-Compromising-on-natural-gas.aspx#.UwtZGs5kjzM">http://www.commonwealthmagazine.org/Voices/Back-Story/2014/Winter/006-Compromising-on-natural-gas.aspx#.UwtZGs5kjzM</a></span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/6d4166eedbae16c6ed0381e9baada93c.jpg"></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the permit, the plant will be allowed to “operate 
normally” for 10 years until 2026, when it will have to start cutting 
its emissions. The </span><span>Salem</span><span> coal plant currently 
emits about 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The new gas plant will be 
allowed to emit over 2 million tons per year until 2026.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then
 it will have to gradually cut back to 1 million tons over the next 20 
years (2.5% reduction per year). This level of emissions is completely 
unsustainable. Rather than quickly ramping up renewables and lessening 
our energy needs, we are planning on emitting <u>more</u><span>&nbsp; </span>C02 for the next 10 years. We are not just kicking a can down the road, we are kicking a hand-grenade!</span></p>
<p><span>This kind of policy isn’t going to work, not for Massachusetts and not for the </span><span>US</span><span>.
 We are increasing the total amount of C02 in the atmosphere at an 
alarming rate. And once it is there, we cannot control the consequences.
 The world has changed, the climate has changed, and we will need to 
quickly change, or face a planet that can sustain only a fraction of the
 humans now on it. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Let’s get busy 
now. Let’s show what humans are capable of at their best.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>I was delighted to read today that
 Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel plans to reduce the Army to the smallest 
size since before WW II. <span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/us/politics/pentagon-plans-to-shrink-army-to-pre-world-war-ii-level.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/us/politics/pentagon-plans-to-shrink-army-to-pre-world-war-ii-level.html</a>
 This is excellent news and appropriate for the current geo-political 
environment. Less good news is that the Defense budget for fiscal 2015 
is $496 billion. Let’s reduce that another 1% each year and put the 
money ($49 million the first year!) towards renewable energy, 
smartgrids, and other proved technologies to reduce our carbon 
emissions. Any states that are losing military jobs can have green 
energy jobs instead! We need to seriously realign our spending with what
 scientists have been telling us for decades about climate change. We 
need to immediately cut our use of fossil fuels and their dangerous GHG 
emissions. There is no time to lose. We have already stalled too long. 
Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline right NOW! Climate disruption is 
happening now and will only get worse. Let’s use our time and money 
wisely.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>I admire Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, for her forceful calls to action during the financial crisis of 2008. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/business/economy/as-crisis-loomed-in-2008-yellen-called-for-action-and-told-jokes.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/business/economy/as-crisis-loomed-in-2008-yellen-called-for-action-and-told-jokes.html</a><span>&nbsp; </span>She
 persistently cajoled her colleagues to do more to help ordinary 
households. We need about a hundred Janet Yellens to advocate for swift 
and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions RIGHT NOW! There 
won’t be much of a world economy if we let climate change spin out of 
control, and the tiny incremental steps we are currently making are far 
too small and tenuous to head off a climate crisis.<span>&nbsp; </span>“I
 don’t believe in gradualism in circumstances like these” Ms. Yellen 
said in March 2008, and these words resonate loudly when I think of 
current emissions levels and the amount of CO2 already in the 
atmosphere. I don’t know if Ms. Yellen has ever spoken on climate 
change, but I would hope that her analytic powers have brought her to 
the same dire view of the climate crisis as most scientists. Please stop
 the Keystone XL pipeline and show how serious YOU are about the climate
 crisis.<span>&nbsp; </span>We cannot afford any more gradualism. The time for bold action is NOW!</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>As background, the article 
reminded us that federal standards will require “a fleet-wide average of
 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.” That’s more than <u>double</u> the 
current 25 mpg! There is no way car companies are going to meet the 
goal, not unless you count electric cars as getting 1000 miles per 
gallon, or some other sleight of hand! The really chilling statement in 
the article is that car companies want to “continue to provide the 
larger <b><u>and more profitable</u></b> vehicles that buyers <b><u>want</u></b> [like the] F-150 truck.” Buyers want that truck for 2 reasons: advertizing and <b><u>cheap gas</u></b>. Ford depends on cheap gas for PROFIT. But this short-term profit comes at <b><u>great expense</u></b> to us all and our children. Please double the price of gas at the pump immediately! That’s what it costs in </span><span>Europe</span><span>.
 Make small cars the profit center for car companies! Do not put 
corporate profit above the best economic planning based on the best 
scientific data! The </span><span>US</span><span> is the #1 carbon 
polluter per capita in the world (for countries with populations larger 
than 30 million)! The science is there. Now we need the policy to match 
the science. And since I know you can’t single-handedly double the price
 of gas, please stop the Keystone XL pipeline! We are emitting almost as
 much carbon as ever! We have got to turn this trajectory around post 
haste.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span>promotes switching from diesel 
electricity generation to renewables. Microgrids are perfect for small 
islands – and there are thousands of small islands that can benefit from
 them. Hooray to Mr. Branson for leap-frogging from diesel to 
renewables, by-passing natural gas completely! The future lies in 
renewables and these islands are taking control of their energy future. 
For large nations with entrenched fossil fuel industries, the future is 
murkier. We too need to eschew natural gas and go straight to 
renewables, but the vested interests will fight that tooth and nail. 
Sometimes smaller players get it right a lot sooner than large ones! 
Please help </span><span>America</span><span> get it right and stop the Keystone XL pipeline! There is no need for this dirty tar sands oil and we need to discourage </span><span>Canada</span><span>

Working Group of 350MA.org at our monthly meeting at my house. Members 
reported on a variety of activities from attending the MIT

 capital improvement plan (CIP) at a public meeting, to joining </span><span>cambridge</span><span> CPAC “climate<span>&nbsp; </span>protection

because regional and state transportation agencies are slow-moving 
bureaucracies that tend not to innovate, but the infrastructure choices 
and decisions they make, the equipment they purchase, lock-in energy 
patterns for decades. Raising the importance of climate change and 
climate disruption on our transportation systems results in better 
long-term planning. This same kind of long-term thinking reveals that 
oil pipelines will soon be retrograde and outdated on planet Earth. 
Let’s not build another one! Please say NO to the Keystone XL pipeline. 
We need to quickly shift to renewables, quickly stop emitting carbon 
pollution. Thank you.</span></p>

 The French call it a quatre-quart (4 quarters). That’s because the 
basic recipe is equal parts of flour/sugar/butter and eggs. The recipe I
 use calls for 5 eggs separated, 2 sticks of butter, 1 ½ cups of sugar 
and 1 ½ cups of flour. I also use a bit of salt, vanilla, baking powder 
and lemon extract. In English we call it pound cake because you can use a
 pound of each of the four basic ingredients. This is a recipe that is 
at least 3 or 400 years old and makes a delicious dense cake. I write 
about this cake today because it symbolizes for me PLENTY. Life is very 
good for many on this planet – we have plentiful food and health and 
friends. There is really no need to keep wanting more and more. Larger 
homes and kitchens and cars don’t give you a better cake. Using more

that we can cut back a little and still have <u>plenty</u>. Please stop

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In November an article appeared in the NY Times on worldwide 
carbon emissions. The headline states “Slowdown in Carbon Emissions 
Worldwide” but this isn’t true! Carbon emissions ROSE in 2012 compared 
with 2011. They just rose <u>more slowly</u> than in previous years. We 
can’t keep doing this. If Planet Earth is a car hurtling towards of 
cliff of climate disaster, we still have our foot on the throttle and 
are speeding up! We are in denial. Life is good. Who cares. We’ll put 
the brakes on later. Thank you to the Global Carbon Project for tracking
 worldwide emissions and providing an excellent web tool for working 
with the data <a href="http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/">http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/</a></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/?q=emissions">http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/?q=emissions</a></span></p>
<p><span>The </span><span>United States</span><span> did slightly reduce its emissions for the year, as did </span><span>Europe</span><span>.
 But since we have put most of the carbon in the atmosphere in the last 
150 years, we need to do more. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline. 
Please show you want to seriously tackle carbon emissions because it is 
the only moral choice.</span></p>

<p><span>CO2 fluctuated in the atmosphere at between 200 and 300 pp 
million for the last 800,000 years – through 6 known ice ages. But then 
the industrial revolution came and we started burning a lot of fossil 
fuels and rapidly increasing CO2 in the atmosphere. From 1750 to 1979 
CO2 went from 278 ppm to 332 ppm – higher than it had ever been before 
in 800,000 years. As we came out of the last ice age, the world warmed 4
 to 5 degrees C over a period of 7000 years. But CO2 has increased from 
1979 to 2014 from 332 ppm to 397 ppm. At this rate we will experience 4 
to 5 degrees C of warming by 2100 or so! That is global warming at 10

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hello from </span><span>London</span><span>. I’m here in </span><span>Scotland</span><span> and </span><span>England</span><span> seeing friends. The Scots are going to vote in September on whether they want to separate from </span><span>England</span><span>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/world/europe/scot-oil-and-gas-an-issue-in-vote-on-independence.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/world/europe/scot-oil-and-gas-an-issue-in-vote-on-independence.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>It is probably not a good idea. Smaller units don’t work as 
well as medium-sized ones these days. Unfortunately, a lot of people are
 going to just vote their emotions and so the separatists may win. It is
 important for us to use our emotions properly – good for human 
relations, but not so good for decision-making. So please decide to stop
 the Keystone XL pipeline because it is <u>not</u> a reasonable path 
forward. We, instead, need to reduce our use of fossil fuels and 
concentrate on renewable energy. So think about the <u>whole</u> <u>planet</u> and what is best for that – not just your own backyard.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Well </span><span>Russia</span><span> has taken over the Crimean peninsula and Putin is wildly popular in </span><span>Russia</span><span> this week. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/ukraine.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/ukraine.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The pro-Russian Ukrainian government collapsed a month ago (21 Feb) and the new government was decidedly pro-Europe. </span><span>Ukraine</span><span> was looking to join the EU. </span><span>Russia</span><span> had already lost the Baltics to the EU, and it was not going to let the </span><span>Ukraine</span><span> “go west.” But how do you attach </span><span>Crimea</span><span> to </span><span>Russia</span><span>?

Do goods for </span><span>Crimea</span><span> now go by sea into </span><span>Kerch</span><span>?
 Do the 2 million Crimeans get a better life? And during all this 
upheaval the state of the world’s carbon budget goes unheeded. We humans
 are so much better at short-term crisis-management than long-term 
change that I wonder whether we will get serious about climate change in

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another cold day yesterday – temperatures didn’t rise above 
freezing. It’s a bit better today but still cold for the season. A 
weather chart today showed how snowy this winter has been for the </span><span>Midwest</span><span> and East Coast. </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Philadelphia</span><span> has had TRIPLE their average snowfall and </span><span>Chicago</span><span>, </span><span>Detroit</span><span>, </span><span>Cincinnati</span><span>, </span><span>Washington</span> <span>DC</span><span> and </span><span>New York</span><span> have all had DOUBLE the usual amount. This data clearly shows we are in the throes of <b>climate disruption</b>.
 As the disruptions increase they will impact agriculture more and more 
and other businesses as well. Say goodbye to nice steady seasonal 
weather patterns and say hello to lots more sudden and severe weather 
shifts. Increased carbon pollution is causing Planet Earth to warm, but 
not in a slow steady manageable way! Mark my words – we are going to see
 2 or 3 major weather disasters in different parts of the world <b>simultaneously</b>! Let’s hope we can cut carbon pollution to avoid some of the worst <b>human</b>
 disasters. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline NOW. Please get serious
 about climate change NOW! We cannot afford to wait. A tiny rise in 
average global temperature sounds manageable, but not when each locality
 has wild swings.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 341</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An interesting article on 28 Feb showed that </span><span>Albany</span><span>
 has become a hub for train shipments of Bakken Crude oil, and outlined 
various safety concerns surrounding this development. I hope these 
concerns can be quickly addressed. </span></p>
<p><span>Of particular interest to <b>me</b> is the speed at which the Bakken fields have been developed. </span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/4de7732a21a8cec4dd3e39752e8f4146.jpg" width="553" height="445"></span></p>
<p><span>US</span><span> oil production from the Bakken fields is up to 960,000 barrels <b>per day</b> – that is up 400% since 2008. And the oil is being transported to US refineries <b>all over the country</b>. What this means is the </span><span>US</span><span>
 doesn’t need the Canada Tar Sands oil because we are swimming in 
boatloads of our own! TransCanada wants the Keystone XL pipeline so it 
can refine the stuff on the </span><span>Gulf</span> <span>Coast</span><span> and <b>then export it</b> to </span><span>Asia</span><span>. Anyone who thinks KXL will help the </span><span>US</span><span> be oil independent is misinformed and mistaken. The KXL is of no general economic benefit to the </span><span>US</span><span>. The profit is all for TransCanada and a few </span><span>Gulf</span> <span>Coast</span><span>
 refineries. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline. It is a pipeline we 
truly don’t need. I’m not happy we are pumping so much Bakken crude. But
 since we are, there is really NO argument in favor of </span><span>Canada</span><span>’s Kolossal Xcessive Lame pipeline! We don’t need to take the risk to our environment for their gain! <br>

<p><span><a href="http://www.waterkeeper.org/">http://www.waterkeeper.org</a></span></p>
<p><span>Members of these two groups flew over the Duke Energy Cape Fear
 Ash Ponds last week and photographed workers diverting water to a canal
 to flow into the </span><span>Cape Fear River</span><span> near </span><span>Moncure</span> <span>NC</span><span>.
 Their actions prompted state regulators to investigate and Duke is now 
charged with dumping as much as 61 million gallons of coal-ash 
wastewater into rivers since last September. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/us/north-carolina-says-utility-pumped-millions-of-gallons-of-ash-waste-in-river.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/us/north-carolina-says-utility-pumped-millions-of-gallons-of-ash-waste-in-river.html</a></span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 343</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>A full-page add titled Nuclear Matters appeared in the NY Times<span>&nbsp; </span>the other day. It promotes nuclear energy as reliable, carbon-free and economic. </span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/6fd5fb0ade808832d8ee5b75eb403e39.jpg" width="374" height="484"></span></p>
<p><span>I agree with these statement but I am unnerved at not knowing who <b>paid</b> for the ad. A website is listed at the bottom, and I went to it</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nuclearmatters.com/">www.nuclearmatters.com</a></span></p>
<p><span>but still couldn’t figure out who spent the money on this 
message. There was a contact email on the website and so I wrote and 
asked who they were. That was a few days ago and I’ve gotten no reply. I
 learned in graduate school that communication was a social act 
involving an emitter, a recipient, and a message. But in our electronic 
age we are bombarded with failed communication acts – one message sent 
to millions of recipients (as in spam) and messages lacking a source (as
 here). Let’s put the human element back into communication. </span></p>
<p><span>You can only <b>trust</b> a message if you know from whence it comes.<span>&nbsp; </span>And one trusts people whose actions are commensurate with their words. <b>You</b> talk about the urgency of climate change but I don’t see you <b>acting accordingly</b>. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline to renew my trust in you. It’s bad for the climate and all of us. We need <b>some</b> nuclear power, but I wonder who doesn’t want their name associated with that message! Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Susan Ringler, Gotta Know Who’s Talking</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;P. S. Returning to the website a week later, it lists 
former senators Bayh and Gregg as head organizers. At least the message 
now has an emitter!<br>

<p><b><span>Letter # 344</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>I loved the article about a new wind technology: BATS – Buoyant
 Air Turbines. These energy generators float 1000 ft in the air and can 
be adjusted to capture the most energy from changing winds. What a great
 idea. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/energy-environment/wind-industrys-new-technologies-are-helping-it-compete-on-price.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/energy-environment/wind-industrys-new-technologies-are-helping-it-compete-on-price.html</a>?</span></p>
<p><span>It looks like they’ll be used first in places like </span><span>Alaska</span><span> and other places that now rely on diesel, but could be used in lots of places at a <b>very</b>
 low cost. Let’s develop these technologies quickly. let’s wean 
ourselves from fossil fuels. Let’s protect the climate by stopping <b>carbon emissions</b>. So hats off to Altaeros Energies and to the state of </span><span>Alaska</span><span>, the Energy Dept. and the Agriculture Dept for supporting their work. The </span><span>US</span><span> government could do <b>much</b> more to support the quick adoption of renewable energy. Here is one example. and you could <b>do much</b>
 more to show how urgent a problem you believe climate change to be! 
Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Stop it today. There are much less
 harmful ways to satisfy our energy needs. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Letter # 346</span></b></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>I was happy to read the other day that Exxon has agreed to 
publically state to their shareholders the risks that stricter limits on
 carbon emissions pose to their business. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/in-a-shift-exxon-agrees-to-report-on-carbon-asset-risk.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/in-a-shift-exxon-agrees-to-report-on-carbon-asset-risk.html</a>?</span></p>
<p><span>They currently place valuations on oil reserves that assume that <b>all of those reserves</b> will be pumped and sold. Current scientific understanding says we <b>cannot</b> burn all those reserves without destroying the planet. So reserves that cannot be used have <b>NO</b>
 value to the company. The same is true of all the other large oil and 
gas companies worldwide. I look forward to seeing what Exxon says about 
this situation – supposedly on Monday. I, for one, have divested my 
investment portfolio of big oil and gas. Their business models are 
unsustainable. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY! We need to 
quickly reduce our carbon emissions. We can’t afford to wait any longer.

<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your new website <a href="http://climate.data.gov/">climate.data.gov</a>, although its ability to simulate and visualize disasters is probably years away. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/us/politics/white-house-to-introduce-climate-data-website.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/us/politics/white-house-to-introduce-climate-data-website.html</a>
 The real problem is that sea level rise and flooding will be uneven, so
 if scientists agree that global levels are rising, they don’t agree on 
the particulars. So what your visualization tools will need are a series
 of dials, so a “Sandy-type” storm hitting a particular town could be 
adjusted for tide levels on a particular day, long slow rain 
accumulation versus short fast, and other pre-existing conditions. It 
could be a bit like the old computer game Roller Coaster Tycoon where 
you could vary the height, the slope and the speed of the roller 
coaster, sometimes to disastrous effect. You don’t actually need huge 
amounts of NASA and NOAA data, a few recent benchmark storms overlaid on
 local tide tables could give a good start. Meanwhile, please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline! Stop it NOW! The sooner we cut carbon emissions, 
the less disruption we’ll have to our climate and lives. Our carbon 
pollution is building a rollercoaster of climate disasters! Let’s try to
 limit the dangers!</span></p>

<p><span>Russia</span><span> has the fuel: oil and gas; </span><span>Ukraine</span><span> has the pipelines; </span><span>Europe</span><span> has the cash to buy. So the three are interlinked. </span><span>Russia</span><span> recently upped the price of natural gas for the </span><span>Ukraine</span><span> from $350 to $500 per 1000 cubic meters. </span><span>Europe</span><span> pays $350. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/world/europe/russia-steps-up-economic-pressure-on-kiev.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/world/europe/russia-steps-up-economic-pressure-on-kiev.html</a>?</span></p>
<p><span>Germany</span><span> buys Euros 40M of energy from </span><span>Russia</span><span> and sells it Euros 40M of manufactured goods. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/world/europe/obama-russia-crimea.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/world/europe/obama-russia-crimea.html</a>?</span></p>
<p><span>Ukraine</span><span> now wants </span><span>Germany</span><span>’s help on a reverse-flow pipeline –so </span><span>Ukraine</span><span> can buy cheaper fuel from</span><span></span><span> Europe</span><span>! <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/world/europe/russia-steps-up-economic-pressure-on-kiev.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/world/europe/russia-steps-up-economic-pressure-on-kiev.html</a>?</span><span>
 This is ridiculous because that “cheaper fuel” is Russian. Posturing 
over pipelines is just a way to negotiate price! Meanwhile US oil/gas 
company opportunists lobby for faster permitting of export LNG to </span><span>Europe</span><span> and </span><span>Ukraine</span><span> to lessen </span><span>Russia</span><span>’s dominance. </span><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/world/europe/us-seeks-to-reduce-ukraines-reliance-on-russia-for-natural-gas.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/world/europe/us-seeks-to-reduce-ukraines-reliance-on-russia-for-natural-gas.html</a></span>

<p><span>The State Dept. claims this is good for our national security and </span><span>Europe</span><span>’s&nbsp;!
 So they are all rush rushing to make as much money a possible from

<p><b><span>Letter # 349</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span>It’s tough to discuss inter-related issues when I limit myself 
to one-page letters. So let me expand a little on yesterday’s topic of 
Russian-European-US energy Diplomacy. </span><span>Germany</span><span> is </span><span>Russia</span><span>’s largest gas customer, followed closely by the </span><span>Ukraine</span><span>. </span><span>Germany</span><span> and </span><span>Italy</span><span> each get a third of their imported fossil fuels from </span><span>Russia</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/e53ec5aa54a71a64018ceca7913e330d.jpg" width="514" height="480"></span></p>
<p><span>And it is now in the interest of both </span><span>Europe</span><span> and the </span><span>US</span><span>
 to lessen this dependence on Russian fuel. But it is very important for
 Americans to know that the US State Dept started a new Bureau <b>over 2 years ago</b> for the purpose of energy diplomacy! </span><span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/world/europe/us-seeks-to-reduce-ukraines-reliance-on-russia-for-natural-gas.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/world/europe/us-seeks-to-reduce-ukraines-reliance-on-russia-for-natural-gas.html</a></span></p>
<p><span>The 85-person Bureau of Energy Resources was created in late 
2011 by Hillary Rodham Clinton, “for the purpose of channeling the 
domestic energy boom into a geopolitical tool to advance American 
interests around the world.” </span></p>
<p><span>Last week Carlos Pascual, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/business/global/q-and-a-us-policy-goals-on-global-energy.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/business/global/q-and-a-us-policy-goals-on-global-energy.html</a></span><span> head of this Bureau (and a former American ambassador to </span><span>Ukraine</span><span>!), was sent to </span><span>Ukraine</span><span> to offer them shale gas or LNG. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/world/europe/nato-chief-russia-europe.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/world/europe/nato-chief-russia-europe.html</a> </span>
</p>
<p><span>The State Dept. should not be hawking US fossil fuels abroad. That they are, shows just how small a threat the </span><span>US</span><span>
 government really thinks climate change presents! So please stop the 
Keystone XL pipeline! and shut down the Bureau of Energy Resources! Your
 legacy will be tarnished forever if you don’t. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Well today I celebrate the Post Office and especially their <b>Go Green</b>
 stamp. I’ve bought over 300 for my letters to you. They encourage us to
 “Reduce our environmental footprint step by step.” I was hoping, when I
 started these letters asking you to <i>Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline</i>, that I wouldn’t have to write this many. But here I am, 13 months later, still writing. Bill McKibben named his non-profit </span><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial;">350.org</span></b><span>
 hoping it would get us to limit carbon emissions to a safe level. It 
didn’t work, but he didn’t stop. I won’t stop either! Please stop the 
KXL now! I’ll keep picking up my pen until you pick up yours. </span></p>
<p><span>To repeat what I said in <a href="http://www.imaginevividly.com/Climate_Action_Letters.php#lett7">Letter #7</a>

Letter # 351<br>
<br>
Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read with interest Thomas Friedman’s column yesterday about how 
important the “petro-money” is to the Russian economy, and I agree with 
much of what he says. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/opinion/friedman-follow-the-money.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/opinion/friedman-follow-the-money.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we disagree is the extent to which the US is <b>also</b> a 
petro-economy. The US State Dept. is rushing to sell Europe and the 
Ukraine LNG through the Bureau of Energy Resources! We just want the 
petro-money to flow here. Friedman wears rose-colored glasses through 
which he sees us “safely expanding natural gas and renewable energy” and
 thereby containing the “Putin threat.” But time is running out for the 
world and carbon emissions continue to mount. Switching from coal to gas
 makes them <b>mount more slowly</b>! But that’s not enough. We continue
 in the thrall of petro-money! Gas is not a clean bridge to the future, 
it is still CARBON! So please STOP the Keystone XL pipeline TODAY! We 
need to tax carbon and develop renewables. It’s the only sensible thing 
to do. As long as we let the oil companies run the global economy, we 
are all in big trouble. Let’s turn this train around and avoid a huge 
wreck! Please do your part.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Letter # 352</p>
<p>(2<sup>nd</sup> letter today)<br>
<br>
Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well the Supreme Court just ruled that people can spend as much money on political donations as long as they spread it around. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/us/politics/supreme-court-ruling-on-campaign-contributions.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/us/politics/supreme-court-ruling-on-campaign-contributions.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chief Justice Roberts says the ruling upholds the basic “right to 
participate in electing our political leaders.” Participate? I thought 
you did that by voting!! Roberts claims my $10 and someone’s $1 Million 
are both just <b>participation</b>! Clearly not! Didn’t Orwell tell us 
that “All pigs are equal, but some pigs are more equal than others.” 
This is a black day for American democracy. I am ashamed that the 
highest court in our land refuses to admit the corrosive power of money.
 Maybe our slowness in developing renewable energy is because no one 
owns the sun and the wind – so there’s not as much money to be made as 
in fossil fuels! So please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline and put more 
money into renewable energy. That’s the direction we need to head.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Letter # 353</p>
<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPCC came out with their starkest language on climate change this week. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/earth/climate.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/earth/climate.html</a></p>
<p>For the first time they mentioned <b>crop failures</b> so huge as to put the <b>world’s food supply</b>
 at considerable risk! We’re not talking a local drought, but 
disruptions much larger and more severe! And for all this talk, carbon 
emissions are continuing to rise! Meanwhile the level of denial is still
 so high in the US that Congress still blocks regulations on coal and 
the New York Times devotes its lead editorial to “Climate Signals 
Growing Louder.” </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/opinion/climate-signals-growing-louder.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/opinion/climate-signals-growing-louder.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Eduardo Porter correctly emphasizes the <b>chaotic</b> and <b>disruptive</b> weather problems that we can expect. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/business/energy-environment/a-200-year-old-forecast-for-food-scarcity-may-yet-come-true.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/business/energy-environment/a-200-year-old-forecast-for-food-scarcity-may-yet-come-true.html</a></p>
<p>We are in for trouble! It’s going to be grim before a lot of people get the message!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/world/climate-study-puts-diplomatic-pressure-on-obama.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/world/climate-study-puts-diplomatic-pressure-on-obama.html</a> </p>
<p>But for those of us who understand how much human suffering these severe disruptions will cause, the path is clear! We must <b>all</b>
 do what we can to reduce carbon emissions as quickly as possible. 
Please pick up your pen and stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today! It’s a 
really important step down the road to a livable climate for the future.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Letter # 354</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>Charles Keating died this week, a man who caused the savings and loan
 crisis in the 80’s, claimed doggedly that he had done nothing wrong, 
but caused huge losses of life savings for thousands of small customers.
 </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/business/charles-keating-key-figure-in-the-1980s-savings-and-loan-crisis-dies-at-90.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/business/charles-keating-key-figure-in-the-1980s-savings-and-loan-crisis-dies-at-90.html</a></p>
<p>He was already a millionaire when he started his junk bond spree in 
1984 and by 1987 the Fed. Home Loan Bank Board was so alarmed they tried
 to rein him in and investigate. Keating turned to 5 influential 
senators to pressure the Bank Board to back off, which bought him 2 more
 years of reckless greedy speculation. Three senators, all Democrats, 
were eventually “rebuked” by the Senate Ethics committee: Alan Cranston,
 Donald Riegle and Dennis DeConcini. Until then I had thought that Alan 
Cranston was a good guy, but greed and power and crony-ism led him to 
aid and abet Keating! Don’t close yourself up in the rarefied realms of 
Washington. Keep your moral compass. Stay grounded. The health and 
welfare of millions are in your hands. Please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline. Stop it RIGHT NOW! Don’t let Canadian greed sway you to put 
off <b>rapid carbon reductions</b>! It’s only one piece of the problem, but it <b>does</b> matter. Please do the right thing for us all.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Letter # 355</p>
<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>On Tuesday 1 April a number of US Catholic bishops held outdoor 
masses to call for immigration reform and to honor those who have died 
trying to cross into the United States. Samantha Sais took a powerful 
photo of Bishop Gerald Kicanas of Tuscon offering communion through the 
bars of a border fence near Nogales, AZ. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/5a81f96b7c048d5a5e001bbe4f7f07e7_mpyg.jpg" width="523" height="333"></p>

<p>As the world experiences more severe and frequent climate 
disruptions, richer countries will first resort to more fences, as 
around the Spanish enclave of <span>Melilla<a name="355-Melilla">&nbsp;</a></span>. But I hope we learn quickly that cooperation and respect for nature and our planet are where the <b>true solutions</b>
 to climate change lie. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline as one step
 along the way to a more healthy and equitable world. Social justice and
 climate justice issues are connected. The poor and disenfranchised will
 suffer most. I encourage you to act boldly on climate change <b>and</b>
 immigration reform. But ultimately climate change will kill more people
 if we are too slow to act – a sobering statement, but necessary. So 
please stop KXL. It is very important. <br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>Letter # 356</p>
<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>The other day a friend asked me about my letters to you and I sighed 
and said I was still writing but getting a bit disheartened. My trust in
 you, that you will do the right thing and stop the Keystone XL Pipeline
 is wavering. But my friend is even more solidly a genetic Democrat than
 I am, and is sure you are only waiting for the midterm elections to be 
over! We bet $20 on it – and I would dearly love to lose that bet! So 
until then I will keep writing! Someone has to keep the pressure up on 
this issue. Someone has to keep KXL on the radar screen of easily 
avoidable <b>bad ideas</b>! So hats off to my friend Jim Silva who 
remains a staunch supporter of yours. In his honor and in honor of other
 hard working Americans who don’t have time to write to you, I ask you 
to <b>please</b> stop the KXL!! It’s a terrible idea, a pipeline we just don’t need.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I send you this PINK huipil because I need a shot of bright colors 
after a spate of sobering letters. Humans need art and love and joy and 
so when they need clothes they sometimes make them creative statements. I
 don’t actually like the color sensibility of this one – but I sure hope
 the person who wove it did!<span>&nbsp; </span>Weaving takes a long 
time! Huipils make me think of edges – of balance and imbalance – they 
embody community, each village with its own colors and patterns. But 
community can devolve into tribalism where we fight each other. Some 
color combinations I find more harmonious, and others jarring. But I try
 not to be too prejudiced! Colors are great. I can’t imagine the world 
without them. So I send you this huipil as a reminder that communities <b>include</b> and tribes <b>exclude</b>. So please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline, and the whole human community will thank you someday. I thank you today.</p>

<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>I was happy to read that Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald have 
received the Polk journalism award for national security reporting. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/business/media/polk-award-winners-to-accept-in-person.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/business/media/polk-award-winners-to-accept-in-person.html</a>? </p>
<p>They are accepting the award <b>in person</b> in NYC and it is their <b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">first</span></b>
 visit since last June when they worked with Edward Snowden to publicize
 documents concerning vast and illegal NSA surveillance programs. How 
sad that Mr. Snowden cannot join the festivities. He is a man of 
principle and much to be admired for his actions on behalf of free 
speech rights. Speech is <b>not free</b> under sweeping government 
surveillance. We should be ashamed of our government’s attempt to label 
him a traitor. The NSA really needs to be reined-in! Please slash their 
budget and invest the money in renewable energy. In the long run it will
 serve our national security much better. Please say NO TODAY to the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. Let’s get going on quickly <b>reducing</b> our dependency on fossil fuels! Thank you.</p>

<p>Letter # 359</p>
<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>Yesterday I spent much of the day outside in the sun working on a 
mosaic mirror. It feels great to work with color and listen to the birds
 and feel the breeze blow. I’ve been wondering a lot lately if I have 
been covering the important topics in these letters, or whether I have 
missed some things. This has led to a spate of serious letters and so I 
need to swing the pendulum back and play up creativity and grace and 
plenty. Spring is a time of renewal, of springing forth again, of 
burgeoning plenitude. We don’t need greed to be happy. We don’t need to 
risk trashing the climate to have plenty. So please STOP the Keystone XL
 Pipeline. We don’t need it. Let’s put our energies behind shifting the 
balance from fossil fuels to renewables. Let’s spring into action! <b>Yes we can</b> make changes to our environmental and energy policies. So please lead the way!</p>

<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>Last week President Faust of Harvard explained her feeble reasons for <b>not</b> divesting Harvard’s portfolio from Big Oil. </p>

<p>This is inspiring! Harvard faculty is what makes Harvard Harvard! 
Many stay for decades. They are pillars of the intellectual community of
 our country. They wield way more clout than current students or alumni ,
 both of whom have been waging <br>
DIVEST campaigns. Hooray to be joined by a significant faculty group. <b>There</b>
 is a voice she must take more seriously! So please step up and do your 
part. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY! We need to quickly

<p>Letter # 361</p>
<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>With all respect for the human tragedy of the senseless Boston 
Marathon bombing one year ago, I was also dismayed at the massive amount
 of news time and media reporting on the anniversary, and the types of 
details that were stressed. There were lots of human interest stories 
and pictures of prosthetic legs. But a particularly chilling article 
about the day to day existence of the bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 
was relegated to yesterday’s newspaper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/us/marathon-bombing-suspect-waits-in-isolation.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/us/marathon-bombing-suspect-waits-in-isolation.html</a> </p>
<p>He is not a threat to others, but is being held in isolation under 
special federal rules that are inhumane, in order to punish him. The 
prosecution is seeking the death penalty and withholding documents from 
the defense. This is not how a civilization based on due process under 
the law should operate. We are only as free as the <b>least free</b> 
person in our society. Thank you to the journalists for reporting on his
 confinement, for treating him as a human being, and to ACLU for their 
efforts on his behalf.</p>
<p>To pull together after a tragedy is a positive community-building enterprise. But to seek <b>retribution</b>
 is tribal, exclusionary and profoundly negative. I am ashamed at how 
this tragedy is playing out day by day. We can do much better. </p>
<p>Community-building is perhaps the most important work that we as 
humans can perform. As the population rises, we must work together to 
provide a decent life for all. The biggest moral and technical challenge
 for humans in the next decades is CLIMATE CHANGE. We must work 
together, and share solutions, and trust each other, or we will all 
suffer dire consequences.</p>
<p>So in the spirit of <b>community building</b>, please STOP the Keystone XL pipeline. <br>
We must quickly stop using fossil fuels. We live on Planet Earth together. There is no more time to waste on tribal divisions.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Letter # 362</p>
<p>(2<sup>nd</sup> letter today)</p>
<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>There is no gefilte fish for the Passover seder for many Americans this year. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/nyregion/gefilte-fish-is-scarce-this-passover-taste-buds-are-ambivalent.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/nyregion/gefilte-fish-is-scarce-this-passover-taste-buds-are-ambivalent.html</a></p>
<p>The main ingredient in gefilte fish is whitefish that we fish from 
the Great Lakes. But the winter has been so cold that several feet of 
ice still cover the fishing grounds. This is certainly not a very 
important problem, and indeed, it may give the whitefish an unexpected 
respite from overfishing. But it <b>IS</b> one more example of a seasonal product whose availability from year to year may vary wildly in the future.<span>&nbsp; </span>Late springs, early springs, we can expect much more deviation from the norm.</p>
<p>Gefilte fish was a frugal dish that could be made ahead of time. We are not being <b>frugal</b>
 with carbon and we are not planning ahead on how to quickly stop using 
fossil fuels. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline NOW! Do it today! We 
need to act more frugally and emit as little carbon as possible, so 
people can enjoy wonderful meals together for millenia.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/us/politics/general-denies-clemency-to-manning.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/us/politics/general-denies-clemency-to-manning.html</a> </p>
<p>He has ruled that 35 years in prison is an appropriate sentence. 35 
years! for leaking documents that have enlarged the public conversation 
on drones and government surveillance! Buchanan is mistaken and 
inhumane. Manning is neither an anarchist nor a traitor. She deserves 
clemency. </p>
<p>We waste way too much money on surveillance and don’t spend nearly 
enough on trying to protect our climate against the ravages of carbon 
pollution.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline! Stop it NOW!<span>&nbsp; </span>If
 you don’t, I really worry what the climate will be like in 35 years. 35
 years? what am I saying? I worry for what it will be like in 10 years 
or 15. Save these letters. They may prove prophetic – and give clemency 
to Pvt. Manning.</p>

<p>On 15 April Dr. James Hansen spoke at MIT to a large audience of 
mixed ages on a rainy afternoon. He was invited by the MIT student group
 <a href="http://www.imaginevividly.com/FossilFreeMIT.org">FossilFreeMIT.org</a>
 that is working to get MIT to divest from Big Oil. Dr. Hansen speaks 
well and he emphasized what steps we need to take NOW. He calls for:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>a quick phase-out of coal </li>
    <li>NO shale oil, tar sands, or fracking, and </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">an immediate price on carbon.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we do these things starting right now, we have a chance. If we delay, things look bad. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline <b>today</b>
 to take the first step down this path to carbon-free energy. This is 
urgent. Please do it NOW. We need to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 
30% by 2024. This is huge. Let’s get started!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you.</p>

Letter # 366<br>
<br>
Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>I was thrilled to read Friday that the State Dept. has delayed its 
decision on the Keystone XL pipeline pending a Nebraska court ruling on 
the matter.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/us/politics/us-delays-decision-on-keystone-xl-pipeline.html?hpw&amp;rref=us&amp;_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/us/politics/us-delays-decision-on-keystone-xl-pipeline.html?hpw&amp;rref=us&amp;_r=0</a></p>
<p>This will certainly push their decision back until after the November
 mid-term elections. This is wonderful news. Every delay shows how large
 the opposition to this pipeline is growing!! We do not need this 
pipeline. We do not want this filthy tar sands oil running through the 
Ogwalla aquifer. I know this is just a small amount of the oil produced 
in the whole world, but we need to start somewhere! <b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You</span></b>
 need to start showing how important carbon pollution is. Please stop 
the Keystone XL Pipeline today. Just pick up your pen and do it!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Letter # 367</p>
<p>(2<sup>nd</sup> letter today)<br>
<br>
Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>I was glad to see a large article on the Keystone XL Pipeline in 
yesterday’s NYTimes Energy section. It is important that more people 
understand how important reducing world-wide carbon emissions is for us 
all.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/business/energy-environment/us-emission-rules-would-far-outweigh-impact-of-keystone-pipeline.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/business/energy-environment/us-emission-rules-would-far-outweigh-impact-of-keystone-pipeline.html</a></p>
<p>For those of us who have been talking about carbon emissions for 
years, we certainly realize that the Keystone XL pipeline represents a 
very small amount of the overall problem. The article mostly emphasized 
how important your EPA coal and car emissions standards will be in 
reducing emissions. So it’s basically a political article, trying to get
 more people on board for your EPA regulations. That’s fine, if it 
works, but actually your EPA regulations are <b>not nearly bold enough</b>. We need to reduce our emissions by 30% by 2030 if not more. So please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline <b>today</b> to show you are <b>very serious</b> about reducing our use of fossil fuels. You can stop KXL without congress – so do it immediately. It sends a strong signal.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p> Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>I am very sad that 16 Sherpas died on Mt. Everest. They are paid very little for the enormous risks they take. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/world/asia/fatal-avalanche-on-mount-everest.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/world/asia/fatal-avalanche-on-mount-everest.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/world/asia/after-everest-disaster-sherpas-contemplate-strike.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/world/asia/after-everest-disaster-sherpas-contemplate-strike.html</a></p>
<p>I would be happy if they refused to climb anymore this season. 
Summiting Mt. Everest has become something hundreds of people pay for 
every year. Two Sherpas for every other climber. They make routes and 
haul supplies and haul people up practically. So foolish and<span>&nbsp; </span>small-minded of the world’s wealthy who have $50K to $100K to spend on this self-indulgence.</p>
<p>The Sherpas deserve much better. Each should get a life insurance 
policy for their family’s benefit. So in honor of these brave Sherpas, I
 ask you to please STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline! Please stop it today. 
We are all connected on this planet, and our runaway carbon emissions 
are a social justice problem, as is the exploitation of Sherpas. We need
 more respect for nature, our climate, and the intricate interactions 
which create a hospitable world for human life.</p>

Letter # 369</p>
<p>(2<sup>nd</sup> letter today)<br>
<br>
Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>I return today to North American oil production forecasts (see also my <a href="http://www.imaginevividly.com/Climate_Action_Letters.php#lett280">letter #280</a>).
 We are pumping more and more oil, keeping the price of it low, and 
consuming more and more! 2013 US oil consumption rose 2.1%. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/business/us-oil-production-keeps-rising-beyond-the-forecasts.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/business/us-oil-production-keeps-rising-beyond-the-forecasts.html</a></p>
<p>Many in the oil industry are <b>happy</b> to project these numbers 
out into the future with NO regard for the disastrous effects of carbon 
on climate change. Yet another article in the NYTimes Energy section 
posited the likelihood of North American energy independence in 2040 
based on <b>increased oil production</b>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/business/energy-environment/challenges-lie-ahead-for-north-american-oil-production.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/business/energy-environment/challenges-lie-ahead-for-north-american-oil-production.html</a>? </p>
<p>But this is a dangerous pipe dream (pun intended)! The recent dire IPCC reports insist we <b>must</b>
 urgently reduce carbon emissions. It is irresponsible to make such 
forecasts. Canada claims it will more than double its annual oil 
production from 2012 to 2030! We cannot let that much <b>more</b> carbon get emitted into the atmosphere! Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY! By 2030 North America needs to reduce its <b>production</b> and <b>consumption</b>
 of fossil fuels. This is critical for our ability to manage climate 
disruptions. Please be realistic and sober about the real cost of fossil
 fuels.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Susan Ringler, Oil Production Must SLOW!</p>

<p> Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>I’m here in Washington DC today where I marched with several thousand
 others in support of the Cowboy and Indian Alliance – CIA – who ask you
 to <b>Reject</b> the Keystone XL Pipeline and <b>Protect</b> the land and water. </p>
<p><a href="http://350.org/thousands-march-with-cowboy-and-indian-alliance-at-reject-and-protect-to-protest-keystone-xl-pipeline/">http://350.org/thousands-march-with-cowboy-and-indian-alliance-at-reject-and-protect-to-protest-keystone-xl-pipeline/</a></p>
<p>Climate change is such a serious problem that we have to get serious 
about leaving fossil fuels in the ground. I met a woman from Maryland 
who marched on a gimpy leg because she believes it is important that you
 know we care deeply about the carbon problem. I met some students from 
Williams College who have finals next week but came all the way here to 
show their support. We came from many states and many walks of life and 
we ask you to please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">The federal gov’t is
spending $215M to build these so that when another storm like </span><span style="font-family: verdana;">Sandy</span><span style="font-family: verdana;"> hits, people can have “the basic necessities.” It
would be more prudent to spend an <b>equal

caused! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">No doubt the gov’t will
also buy the <b>fuel</b> to fill these

Yes “every element of our energy infrastructure “ is at risk! The answer is to
quickly get off <b>fossil fuels</b>! It is really
sad that Big Oil have so much clout that they can delay the demise of fossil

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">It urges PRUDENCE and

Right Now! And yes, we still need nuclear energy and we also need to stop
calling gas CHEAP! The future costs of the carbon emissions are <u>horrendous</u>
and need to be factored in. That would show how gas is NOT cheap. We will never
meet our goal of reducing carbon emissions 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 at

last week in </span><span style="font-family: verdana;">Pensacola</span><span style="font-family: verdana;">. We really need to stop talking about average global
warming because none of us experience <b>averages</b>

all sorts of damage even if they hardly budge the annual “average” at all! We
are dealing with CLIMATE DISRUPTION and it will only get worse.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today!
Please act boldly to show how dangerous climate disruption is. Global warming
is here, but what we experience is greater and greater DISRUPTION. The costs
are huge and MOUNTING. Show your leadership and put reducing carbon emissions
at the center of your national agenda. Thank you for talking to weather

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">I was thrilled to read
that </span><span style="font-family: verdana;">Stanford</span><span style="font-family: verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: verdana;">Univ.</span><span style="font-family: verdana;"> has decided to divest its endowment from COAL stocks. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/education/stanford-to-purge-18-billion-endowment-of-coal-stock.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/education/stanford-to-purge-18-billion-endowment-of-coal-stock.html</a>?
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">This is a good small step
in the right direction. But certainly they could divest from Big Oil too without
undue hardship! I’m hoping that this small step will open the door to
universities divesting from things they believe are harmful. Coal is very
harmful, but other fossil fuels are only marginally less so! We need to quickly
stop burning <b>all</b> fossil fuels.
Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline Right Now! Show that you want BOLD actions
to prohibit the worst of climate changes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">I was appalled to read
recently that the Senate quietly stripped from an intelligence bill the
requirement of an <b>annual public report</b>
on the number of people killed and injured by </span><span style="font-family: verdana;">US</span><span style="font-family: verdana;"> drone strikes. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/world/senate-drops-plan-to-require-disclosure-on-drone-killings.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/world/senate-drops-plan-to-require-disclosure-on-drone-killings.html</a>?
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">James Clapper convinced
the Intelligence Committee that a public report would “undermine the
effectiveness of the operation” and Sen. Dianne Feinstein who originally
proposed the requirement, agreed to remove it! <b>Shame on her! </b>Shame on you for letting the CIA kill as many people
as they want with drones. If publishing the annual number of dead would shock
the American public, then clearly the program needs to be stopped! Where is
your moral compass? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">While you are looking for
it, I suggest you do something positive for future generations – something you
can do alone – without congress: Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. We must <b>urgently</b> cut carbon emissions and you
could show leadership. Please do it NOW. <br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: verdana;">The Central American

low elevation coffee, but has quickly spread to higher altitudes. </span><span style="font-family: verdana;">Guatemala</span><span style="font-family: verdana;"> has been particularly hard hit, losing 20% of its
coffee-jobs, mostly on small farms. </span><span style="font-family: verdana;">Guatemala</span><span style="font-family: verdana;"> is a tough place to be a farmer and coffee, which
thrives on its hillsides, has been one of the few crops to allow families to rise
out of the bleakness of subsistence farming. NOW climate change is decimating
the coffee trees and pushing “many families to the edge of survival.” Climate
change hits the poor far harder than the rich – so please, as an act of SOCIAL
JUSTICE, please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY!! It is a small step, but
one you can do right now, with the stroke of a pen. We need to get off of fossil
fuels as quickly as possible. coffee rust is just one more proof of how
dangerous carbon pollution is.</span></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Gee, the top-paid 25 hedge fund managers in the US</font><span style="font-family: arial;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> were “compensated” $21 billion in 2013. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/hedge-fund-moguls-pay-has-the-1-looking-up/?_r=0">https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/hedge-fund-moguls-pay-has-the-1-looking-up/?_r=0</a></font></span></p>

close to $1 billion each. It is beyond comprehension that these 25 men
(I think they are all men) believe they are worth this much more than
other mortals. It is also beyond comprehension that they don’t pay
INCOME tax on this windfall, but the lower “capital gain” tax rate. So
let’s start a <u>Carbon Trust Fund.</u><span>&nbsp; </span>Those with “compensation” of $10 million or more annually, will contribute 50% of their “compensation” </font></span></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">over
 that amount to a fund for future inhabitants of Planet Earth to keep 
disastrous effects of climate change to a minimum. Gee. We could start 
that fund with about $10 billion this year! That would bring the “cost” 
of solar and wind power way down, if spent appropriately. And remember 
this isn’t a tax or income redistribution. This is a trust fund from 
excess “compensation.” So, in the meantime, please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline – because you can do THAT today.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">The electric RAV4 didn’t sell well

 came late to the electric car product, so is quitting. I hope history 
shows that they are making the wrong decision – but we’ll have to wait a
 decade or so to see. You are definitely making the wrong decision in 
not pushing more aggressively a robust plan to lessen carbon emissions! 
And we don’t have to wait decades to find that out! Climate change is

They are sandbagging the regional power plant hoping to keep electricity

salute to Richard Diebenkorn. This one is at the National Gallery, so 
you can go see it. Diebenkorn’s birthday is 22 April, but that was Earth
 Day, hard to compete with. So I send you this card a month later. What I
 really admire in Diebenkorn is his sense of balance and his ability to 
integrate the large and the small. Your eye always moves pleasingly 
around one of his paintings. He balances colors and shapes and sizes and
 you can always tell which way is up in a Diebenkorn – unlike some 
abstract art. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Your decisions as President are often a
 balancing act. I suggest that the black rectangle at the bottom of this
 painting is small but important to the balance the harmony of the 
whole. So is your decision to stop the Keystone XL Pipeline! Please stop
 it today. It is an important action in your Presidency – which will be 
lessened if you fail to act! Art can remind us that small important acts
 make the difference between greatness and mediocrity. Thank you.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">In an article yesterday about US 
efforts to help hunt for the 260 kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls, was the
 careful statement that the 80 troops sent to Chad are not ground 
troops. “They are mostly Air Force crew members, maintenance specialists
 and security officers for unarmed Predator surveillance drones.” </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/world/africa/us-sends-troops-to-aid-hunt-for-nigerian-schoolgirls.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/world/africa/us-sends-troops-to-aid-hunt-for-nigerian-schoolgirls.html</a></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Wow. Since when has a drone needed its
 own security officer? Is this job-title inflation? Have drone handlers 
become security officers? Or are the people flying them the air force 
crew members? And the security officers are there for what? To redact 
the photos? To control the message? Meanwhile climate change is upon us.
 That is the message that cannot be redacted or controlled. We can 
continue to ignore it for a while – but at our peril! Please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline to show you are serious about curbing carbon 
emissions. Do it today. And try asking the military to use clear job 
titles – more people would trust them if they did. Thank you.</font></p>

</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I write to you today about a young

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Egyptian police arrested him for 
creating an anti-government rebel group, charges he denies. Please 
welcome this bright young man. Egypt’s loss is our gain. The world needs
 more bright young engineers to help us with the mounting problems 
caused by our denial of climate change! Let’s hope we stop using fossil 
fuels <b>very soon</b>. But even then we will need all the ingenuity of <b>legions</b> of bright engineers to help the world deal with decades of climate instability. </font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">New immigrants, new ideas, the US 
needs to step up to its role as a forward-thinker. Big changes are 
coming. We need to get out in front of the climate change problem. 
Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline right now. Show your leadership and
 acknowledge this is a huge problem. Stopping KXL is a small step in the
 right direction. Do it NOW for all the bright 17 year olds on the 
planet.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"><br>
Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">On Thursday the Thai military staged another coup. The NY Times headline said “Thwarting </font><b><font style="font-size: 12px;">Populist </font><font style="font-size: 12px;">Movement.”</font></b><font style="font-size: 12px;"> It did </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>not</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"> say “Thwarting </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>Democracy</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;">.</font>” </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/world/asia/thailand-military-coup.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/world/asia/thailand-military-coup.html</a></font></p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">The Thai elite cannot win an election.
 They are outnumbered by the rural poor and have lost every election 
since 2001. It matters what words we use. A “<b>democracy</b>” is inherently good: a system based on free and fair elections. A “<b>populist movement</b>”
 is used for things like the Occupy movement. They are smaller, 
dis-organized, not yet powerful enough to win seats in national 
elections. Calling Thailand’s <b>democracy</b> a <b>populist movement</b> is insulting and mis-leading.</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I wish Thailand well in their attempts
 at democracy and hope they can quickly regain stability. Unfortunately 
the future stability of many nations will be severely tested by </font><u>climate change</u><font style="font-size: 12px;">.
 That is why it is SO important that we act decisively NOW to reduce our
 carbon emissions. A world with fewer democracies will be less able to 
tackle the enormity of the climate change challenges. PLEASE stop the 
KXL pipeline NOW. Show your moral fiber. Step up to the trust we put in 
you as our elected President. Thank you.</font></p>

<br></font></b></p>
<p>Dear President Obama,</p>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Yesterday I joined 10 or 12 others handing out leaflets and buttons for “Divest Harvard” outside a 50</font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"><sup>th</sup></font><font style="font-size: 11px;"> <font style="font-size: 12px;">Reunion event.</font> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/divestharvard/">https://www.facebook.com/divestharvard/</a></font> 
</p>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">These people are about 72 years old 
and many have signed the alumni petition asking Harvard to Divest from 
Big Oil because of the damage of carbon pollution. We leafleters were a 
cross-section of the Harvard community including current students, 
alums, and faculty. </font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">It is heartening to see that older 
people with a longer perspective, and yet commensurately shorter risk 
period, gravitate to our cause. As with the Keystone XL Pipeline, there 
is little practical effect when Harvard divests – theirs is a large and 
diverse portfolio. But all the more reason to ask them to do it! I ask 
people if they would be angry if Harvard divested from Big Oil. If they 
say NO, then I say they should join us and sign the petition! And so I 
say the same to you. Would you be angry if the Keystone XL Pipeline 
never got built? If not, then you should deny the permit for it. Please 
stop the KXL. Do it today. Your personal gain will be huge. Your 
credibility as Climate Protector will be exponentially enhanced.

Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">This morning I joined 10 other people at a community-organized De-Paving Party. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlTG0Y_zknc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlTG0Y_zknc</a></font> </p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">In 90 minutes we broke up and 
collected about 100 sq. ft. of asphalt from the side yard of a local 
house. The owner is going to put down pavers with holes for the driveway
 area – so grass can grow up – but strong enough to hold a car – and the
 rest will be a garden! What satisfying physical labor it was! Whoopie! 
Let’s green the earth. Let the rain soak in. And the asphalt will be 
melted down to pave roads where it is needed. Please stop the Keystone 
XL Pipeline. We need to green the earth little by little. You can pick 
up your pen and stop that dirty oil we don’t need.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">They are a sensible and modest move in
 the right direction. It is only sad that you will receive so much 
opprobrium from elements of congress and the oil industry for these 
steps. Many Americans don’t have much respect for science and critical 
thinking and the politicians they elect have similar lackings. Such are 
the times we live in, and it does not bode well for the climate and our 
children.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Journalists Gillis and Fountain are

</font><font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Europe has led by example for decades.
 A better plan is Bold ACTION! Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. 
Send a clear message that we MUST quickly reduce our use of fossil

 in congress. But the world will thank you. I thank you in advance.</font></p>

</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Eduardo Porter is correct in characterizing the new EPA rules as<span>&nbsp; </span>“A Paltry Start In Curbing Global Warming.”</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/business/economy/a-paltry-start-in-curbing-global-warming.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/business/economy/a-paltry-start-in-curbing-global-warming.html</a></font> </p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Because 2005 was an emissions peak, 
and because of shale gas, we’ve already reduced our emissions from power
 plants by 16%. We can do much better than this and we MUST do much 
better. The new rules make “just enough progress to shuffle along.” This
 is not leadership! Faced with a hostile congress, the government picks a
 target they think they can make and that could hold up after years in 
the courts. But the Earth doesn’t care about political expediency and we
 carry on damaging the climate with our emissions. We need much bigger 
cuts to carbon emissions, we need much bolder proposals from our 
President! Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY and show you 
really do comprehend the full danger of our climate situation. Now is 
not the time for baby steps! “Baby steps will not take the world where 
we need to go.”</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is melting, and scientists have recently declared that the melt is <b>irreversible</b>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/science/the-melting-isnt-glacial.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/science/the-melting-isnt-glacial.html</a></font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">So that means sea level rise is 100% 
certain! How much more evidence do we need to convince people that 
climate change is a VERY serious problem? This is all happening much 
faster than expected. The faster we cut our carbon emissions, the 
better! We can’t stop the Big Melt in the Antarctic, but we can slow it 
down. We have </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>got to</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">
 stop using fossil fuels. We need way more money on research in 
renewable and non-carbon energy. Our climate and the health of the 
planet are too important to ignore. </font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I send you this wonderful photo of the Golden Gate Bridge because it embodies </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>movement</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">, great leaps forward, although it is a still photograph.</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;">Let’s
 hope your new EPA rules for power plants are like this first section of
 bridge decking. Look at this photo again – see the dynamic energy of a

<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Let’s put reducing carbon emissions on
 a timetable like that of building a bridge. What can we do in 2-4 
years? What section can we build next? Who will oversee the project? </font></p>

</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;">-
 as a first small step towards a carbon-free future for our planet. This
 is a big project and we need a strong leader to galvanize Americans to 
action. Please be that leader. Bridge builders are bold, practical, and 
work to a schedule. You have the skills. Please use them to combat 
climate change.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I read with interest the recent obituary of Maxine Greene, although I had never heard of her before. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/05/nyregion/maxine-greene-teacher-and-educational-theorist-dies-at-96.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/05/nyregion/maxine-greene-teacher-and-educational-theorist-dies-at-96.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">She was an educator who argued 
persuasively that the arts play a key role in education because they 
have “the power to challenge expectations.” She saw an intimate link 
between creative thinking, robust imagining, and flourishing democracy. 
Reading about her reminded me of how important it is to “imagine 
vividly” <a href="http://www.imaginevividly.com/Climate_Action_Letters.php#Lett3">(letter #3</a>)
 and that we all need to be encouraged to “engage with the world not 
just as it is, but as it might otherwise be.” So please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline and start vividly imagining a world based on 
renewable energy, a world with a warmer but </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>manageable</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>climate.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Hooray for Patagonia! I was so pleased
 to read that the Chilean government has rejected an $8 billion plan 
(HidroAysen Plan) to dam the Baker and Pascua rivers for huge 
hydro-electric plants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/world/americas/chile-patagonia-dams-rejected.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/world/americas/chile-patagonia-dams-rejected.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Although Chile is strapped for energy,
 most Chileans opposed the dams, and their government listened. What a 
wonderful day for environmentalists the world over!</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I am so pleased Patagonia will not be 
dug up for this huge project. We need to be smarter about energy 
projects. Transporting electricity long distances is wasteful. It is 
better for Chile to use smaller wind and solar projects closer to their 
cities. I thank the many people who fought for this outcome. In honor of
 them, please STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline. We don’t need to dig up 
this filthy oil, transport it thousands of miles in a pipeline only to 
load it on ships to sell in Asia! That is NOT how to solve our climate 
crisis.</font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Wow! 400 letters! I sure hope someone 
is reading them. In the whole conversation about reducing carbon 
emissions to keep our planet healthy and flourishing, hardly anyone 
mentions that one big impediment to progress away from fossil fuels and 
towards renewables is: NO ONE OWNS THE SUN AND WIND, THEY ARE FREE. When
 “Big Oil and Gas” become “Big Energy” companies, their profits are 
going to come from </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>delivering</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"> energy and </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>optimizing</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>energy. This is a lot less profitable business model than they now have. So they want to slow down the transition. </font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><font style="font-size: 12px;" face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">Government, however, has much to gain from free renewable energy. So governments everywhere should be investing <u>heavily</u> in renewables so that they become – in our tilted economic system, <u>affordable</u>, <u>practical</u>,
 and therefore are quickly adopted. It’s just common sense. Let the 
breeze blow and the sun shine and let’s figure out how to harness them 
efficiently. Please stop the</font> <font style="font-size: 12px;">Keystone XL Pipeline to start shutting off the oil tap. </font></span></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;">
Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">There’s a huge migration problem in 
Europe that will only grow exponentially worse in years to come. Already
 more than 40,000 migrants – mostly from Africa – have reached Italy 
this year by boat. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/world/europe/italians-rescue-migrants-who-left-north-african-shores-on-boats.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/world/europe/italians-rescue-migrants-who-left-north-african-shores-on-boats.html</a>
</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">This is more than the total for 2013! Desertification and other effects of climate change are at work! </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/opinion/europes-migration-emergency.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/opinion/europes-migration-emergency.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Italy says as many as 800,000 are 
massing in Libya trying to reach Europe! Not only do other European 
countries need to help Italy with the cost of this migration, but rich 
nations who are the biggest emitters of CARBON pollution need to change 
their ways very quickly! The US needs to quickly renounce fossil fuels. 
Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>Right Away</u></font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;">!</font> Show you care about the huge social injustice of climate change. We need to do our part. Thank you.</font>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I was interested last week to read about Japan’s ultra-small KEI cars and trucks. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/business/international/japan-seeks-to-squelch-its-tiny-cars.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/business/international/japan-seeks-to-squelch-its-tiny-cars.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">They have only a 0.66 liter engine and
 so have great fuel economy. Unfortunately both Japanese industry and 
government are moving to squelch these little cars. Industry I can 
understand – since the profit margins are low. But government should 
encourage these small practical vehicles. We all need to be thinking 
SMALLER! Smaller carbon footprint, only using what we need – using as 
little fossil fuel as possible. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>Right Now!</u><font style="font-size: 12px;"> Show your support for curbing carbon emissions QUICKLY. Thank you.</font></font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Your new EPA regulations sparked an interesting response from Mark Hertsgaard in Harper’s. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://harpers.org/blog/2014/06/a-top-obama-aide-says-history-wont-applaud-the-presidents-climate-policy/">http://harpers.org/blog/2014/06/a-top-obama-aide-says-history-wont-applaud-the-presidents-climate-policy/</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">He correctly points out that by using 
2005 as your baseline for change (a high point in emissions), you make 
very modest reductions look larger. Your cuts do NOT put us on a path to
 limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius and your small steps are 
completely insufficient! History will not judge you as a hero, but as a 
small incrementalist. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline </font><u><font style="font-size: 12px;">now</font> </u><font style="font-size: 12px;">to
 demonstrate that you know how important immediate change is!! We must 
act decisively NOW. This is no time to wait. Picking numbers to make a 
tiny change look better may be politically expedient NOW, but they will 
be harshly and correctly judged by history. Thank you.</font></p>

</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Melilla is a duty free port completely surrounded by Tunisia, and it is a </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>part of Spain</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;">.</font>
 Because of enormous desertification and horrific wars, more and more 
Africans are climate refugees. Melilla is surrounded by a barbed wire 
fence and on 28 May over a thousand stormed the fence at night and about
 half made it across! We are going to see enormous refugee pressure on 
Europe in the coming decade. But the problem belongs to us all. Please 
stop the Keystone XL pipeline RIGHT </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>now</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">!
 We are causing great damage to the planet and although the poor are the
 first to suffer, we will all suffer in the end. The fence in Melilla 
will continue to get over-run by increasingly desperate climate 
refugees. Please make big changes now! Thank you.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I went to a meeting at the Mass. State
 House in downtown Boston today to hear a report from the MA Dept of 
Transportation on their “GreenDOT” program which intends to “integrate 
sustainability elements into all aspects of MassDOT.” The meeting was 
called by the MA House Comm. On Global Warming and Climate Change to get
 an update on GreenDOT progress. But the progress is very slow because 
there is no money and no push from the Governor and other top officials.
 All electric buses are available, but they cost 2.5 to 3 times as much 
as other buses, so the MBTA is not buying them. We could be doing much 
more, much faster. We are pushing the climate change catastrophe further
 down the road rather than facing it now. If you add in the price of 
carbon pollution, those buses are NOT expensive. We need leadership at 
the top to get this message out. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline 
TODAY! Please give us strong leadership from the top that climate change
 is here NOW and we need to act quickly to get off fossil fuels. Thank 
you.</font></p>

</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I am pleased that your office finally 
released the 2010 memo explaining the legality of drone strikes against 
US citizens, albeit with about 12 pages redacted out of a 41 page 
document. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/opinion/a-thin-rationale-for-drone-killings.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/opinion/a-thin-rationale-for-drone-killings.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">But I am dismayed that the 
justification is largely that “the realities of combat” meant that no 
serious due process was possible. This is a chilling disregard of 
fundamental rights. I applaud the NY Times for quickly voicing their 
dismay that the memo is a “slapdash pastiche of legal theories.” We must
 set ourselves a higher standard, or we will lose all international 
respect.</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Due process rights are about fairness 
and this memo is quick to abandon fairness. We also abandon fairness 
when we emit huge amounts of carbon pollution and don’t take enough 
responsibility for the damage we cause. Please stop the Keystone XL 
pipeline TODAY! Pick up your pen and do it! Since we have emitted a big 
portion of the carbon, it is only fair that we quickly agree to 
dramatically cut our emissions. If the US wants to be known as a place 
where people are fairly treated under the law, we need to act FAIRLY. 
Thank you.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I am pleased to read that the Supreme 
Court upholds the EPA’s authority to regulate GHG emissions from large 
industrial polluters such as power plants and oil refineries. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/us/justices-with-limits-let-epa-curb-power-plant-gases.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/us/justices-with-limits-let-epa-curb-power-plant-gases.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">This demonstrates that even our 
pro-business Supreme Court recognizes the danger of carbon pollution! 
But unfortunately the EPA proposal earlier this month<font style="font-size: 12px;"> is </font></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>not strong</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> eno</font>ugh. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/business/energy-environment/new-carbon-rules-unlikely-to-start-energy-revolution.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/business/energy-environment/new-carbon-rules-unlikely-to-start-energy-revolution.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Because the target is to reduce carbon
 emissions 25 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, we have already achieved
 OVER HALF of that goal through the recession and efficiency. This means
 that utilities will use LESS coal and MORE natural gas, but will still 
be burning coal, by many estimates, in 2030 or 2040! This is 
unconscionable and very irresponsible. We need MUCH steeper reductions 
in carbon emissions much faster is we are to avoid the very worst 
effects of climate change! If we can’t even get rid of coal in the US by
 2030, we are NOT serious about the HUGE problem of climate change. Your
 paltry measures to try and appease everyone are NOT ENOUGH. Please 
immediately stop the Keystone XL pipeline to show you really ARE serious
 about combatting climate change. Thank you.</font></p>

</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Earthquakes are happening and getting 
larger and more frequent in places we don’t usually think are 
susceptible. In April a small article reported that state geologists in 
Ohio linked earthquakes in the Youngstown area to FRACKING itself, not 
just to the waste water injection from fracking. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/us/ohio-geologists-link-earthquakes-to-gas-drilling.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/us/ohio-geologists-link-earthquakes-to-gas-drilling.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Now government officials in Texas, 
Colorado and elsewhere are looking at the earthquake risks of fracking, 
and regulation and law suits could well follow. Maybe the Golden days of
 fracking are coming to a close! That would be great! Fracking was not 
sufficiently studied or regulated because it was profitable. Now risks 
are appearing, and it is clear that the environmental costs of this 
“cheap” fuel will be HUGE. Let’s not delude ourselves that fracked gas 
is “cheap.” It is NOT. The evidence is mounting. When will we put the 
TRUE price on carbon?</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Let’s start NOW. Please stop the 
Keystone XL pipeline NOW and stop pretending that fossil fuels are 
“cheap.” We are already paying the price in climate disruption and it 
will get much worse. Thank you.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I read recently of flooding in Minnesota “as swollen rivers overflow.” </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/us/much-of-minnesota-is-flooded-as-swollen-rivers-overflow.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/us/much-of-minnesota-is-flooded-as-swollen-rivers-overflow.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;">
</font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">The headline sounds benign, but as I 
read further, I realized that the extraordinarily widespread flooding 
was caused by what I’ll call “A TRIPLE CENTENARY”: 3 100-year weather 
events on top of one another! First Minnesota had a very heavy snowfall 
this winter (event 1), then it had an unusually wet spring (event 2) and
 then it got hit with 6 inches of rain in a day – another very unusual 
event! This sort of triple whammy is what we need to be preparing for 
everywhere. Climate disruption is here NOW – and not only do we have 
frequent 100-year events, but we can get several AT ONCE. That really 
causes havoc. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline TODAY! We need to 
send a strong message that the US understands the ENORMOUS problem 
carbon pollution is already causing – and that we are ready to give up 
fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Thank you.</font></p>

Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Sometimes when we read about wars and 
disasters and specific events that just happened, we don’t really see 
the larger pattern. I was struck recently by a small article about VERY 
severe drought in Syria. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/07/world/middleeast/syria-unicef-says-drought-adds-to-safe-water-woes.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/07/world/middleeast/syria-unicef-says-drought-adds-to-safe-water-woes.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Some parts of Syria have received the lowest level of rainfall in 50 years!</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;">Most
 places in Syria have gotten only half their normal rainfall. The civil 
war has been raging since March 2011 and much damage has been done to 
water and sewage systems. UNICEF reports that there is only 1/3 the 
amount of clean water in Syria as there was 3 years ago! What are people
 to do? This is a regional drought also affecting Jordan, Lebanon, and 
Iraq. We are likely to see more and more refugees not just from the war,
 but from climate change! Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline today. We
 need to quickly stop relying on fossil fuels and stop increasing the 
carbon in the air. It’s the only was to lessen climate disaster. Thank 
you.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I was happy to read recently that 
landowners in central Mass. are questioning whether we need yet another 
natural gas pipeline through their properties. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/business/energy-environment/new-england-confronts-surging-demand-for-natural-gas.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/business/energy-environment/new-england-confronts-surging-demand-for-natural-gas.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Kinder Morgan says we need the cheap 
natural gas, but more and more landowners are questioning whether we do!
 As Shanna Cleveland, an attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation, 
says “Big pipelines lock us into a system we need to out grow and 
undermine efforts to address the climate crisis.” Yessiree Bob!!! She is
 right. I’m happy that only half the landowners have let Kinder Morgan 
survey their land. I hope this pipeline gets stalled until we realize we
 don’t need it and don’t want it!</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;">Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline and send YOUR message that fossil fuels are old-school and need to be quickly phased out! </font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I send you this image from a wonderful
 Richard Estes exhibit I saw in Portland Maine. Estes is an 
extraordinary painter who works from photographs. It’s hard to see in 
this postcard, but Estes does what the human eye and photographs cannot:
 he makes every detail crisp, whether near or far. The result is a 
hyper-realism that is unsettling (albeit interesting) as it draws our 
eye to different parts of the canvas. The crispness valorizes every 
detail<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font></font><b><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>equally</u></font></b><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b> </b>and this gives his paintings a </font><b><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>creepy</u></font></b><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b> </b>quality
 for me! The human eye focuses, and that involves CHOICE – to see one 
thing better, we see another less. Similarly, an “all of the above” 
energy policy seems to valorize </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>all</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"> energy sources.</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;">But
 this is an illusion, just as unsettling as an Estes painting. Beyond 
the rhetoric of “all energy,” you still make energy CHOICES.</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;">Please
 stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Please show us that your focus is on 
reducing carbon emissions so the world remains a great place for humans!</font></p>

report to the UN by 15 teams from different countries on how to keep 
global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/business/blueprints-for-taming-the-climate-crisis.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/business/blueprints-for-taming-the-climate-crisis.html</a></font></p>

<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Hats off to Jeffrey Sachs and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for tackling the </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>specifics</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>of
 this huge overhaul to our energy uses. To achieve this goal we must 
reduce carbon emissions by mid-century to NO MORE THAN 1.6 tons per 
person – for every person on the planet. Annual emissions today in the 
US are MORE THAN 16 TONS per person. Ten times too much!</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;">But
 the good news is WE CAN DO THIS! The American team built several models
 to hit the target with different mixes of nuclear, renewables, and some
 carbon capture. They propose, for example, that 15 years from now EVERY
 new car sold in the US would be ELECTRIC! Let’s get started right away 
on this huge task. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline today. Fossil 
fuels are for the past, NOT the future. Let’s get going on the work to 
be done.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I am writing again about the UN report
 yesterday about how to keep global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. The 
report “underscores the </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>pointlessness</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>of small, incremental emissions cuts.” The US needs to cut emissions </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>4 percent every year</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"> to hit the target. This is more than </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>10 times faster</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"> than the EIA forecasts this year. We need to cut carbon FAST.</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;">As Eduardo Porter bluntly states, replacing coal with natural gas is </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>unproductive</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;">. </font>“Cheap” gas and oil are not “cheap.” They will trap us into a high-carbon future at </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>OUR PERIL</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">!
 Stop the Keystone XL pipeline NOW. Please please! What can we do THIS 
YEAR to reduce carbon emissions 10 times faster than last year? Let’s 
get more renewable energy online FAST. Here are the numbers. We can do 
this without crashing the economy. Let’s start NOW. Let’s make it the 
new slogan: 4 percent a year! We can’t afford to put this off any 
longer. Our future is in our hands. We have some plans, now let’s 
execute them. Stop fracking, stop new gas and oil pipelines. Let’s 
strengthen our electric grid and build out renewables. Let’s go for it! 
Thank you.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I liked the opinion piece by David J. 
Hayes today about small modular renewable energy systems that are 
compact and scalable and can be used with wind or solar in remote 
communities. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/opinion/wind-solar-clean-power-off-the-grid.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/opinion/wind-solar-clean-power-off-the-grid.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">This is a technology I would gladly 
invest in. I think it could be quite profitable. Please help get these 
systems off the drawing board and into production. Not only will these 
micro grids help remote communities, they may also provide back up for 
hospitals in emergencies. The dept. of Defense has successfully deployed
 such systems, now let’s spread the technology! Let’s invest in the 
clean technologies we already have and scale them up BIG!! Please also 
stop the Keystone XL pipeline TODAY. It has NO PART in the clean energy 
future of America or the planet. It’s a bad idea that we should not 
encourage in any way. Remember. We need to reduce carbon emissions<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>4 percent every year!! </b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">Every year!</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I write to honor the architect Randall Stout who died of cancer at 56 last week. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/arts/design/randall-stout-architect-of-innovative-environmental-designs-dies-at-56.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/arts/design/randall-stout-architect-of-innovative-environmental-designs-dies-at-56.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><span></span><font style="font-size: 12px;">I had never heard of him 
before reading his obituary, but I love the fact that he designed 
everything from museums to the low-cost Dockweiler Beach Youth Center. 
He used energy-efficient materials when others were not. He designed for
 the future. We will need more architects like him as we face the 
climate crisis in the coming decades. He will be sorely missed.</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">In his honor, please stop the Keystone
 XL pipeline today. We need to stop using fossil fuels and design energy
 systems for a carbon-free future. Look FORWARD Mr. President, with 
optimism and urgency and help get us headed for </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><u>rapid</u></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>change. Remember, we need to reduce our carbon emissions 4 % each year starting NOW! Not 0.4% but 4%. Don’t lose any more time.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Oiii! Oiii! The government should absolutely </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>NOT </b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">be approving guidelines for seismic searching for oil and gas in the Atlantic Ocean! </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/us/white-house-opens-door-to-exploring-atlantic-for-oil.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/us/white-house-opens-door-to-exploring-atlantic-for-oil.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">We have discovered too much oil and 
gas already. We need to turn off the fossil fuel tap! It will destroy 
the planet – make it unfit for human habitation. This is lunacy and also
 very destructive of ocean life and habitats. Why do you let the 
Interior Dept. make such a bad decision? We must cut our carbon 
emissions every year 10 times faster than we are currently doing. There 
is NO room for future oil and gas exploration in this critical phase to 
decarbonize! We cannot just carry on as before. Please stop the Keystone
 XL pipeline NOW. We don’t need it or want it. And please get the 
Interior Dept. tostart saying NO to oil and gas companies.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> Dear President Obama,</font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">I suppose it’s none of my business, 
but I was struck a few months ago, by an article about Kathryn Ruemmler,
 who was your White House Counsel for two years. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/politics/departing-white-house-counsel-held-powerful-sway.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/politics/departing-white-house-counsel-held-powerful-sway.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">The article was mostly about her years as WH Counsel, but also noted she was a lead </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>Prosecutor</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>on Enron, later worked as a white-collar </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>defense</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>lawyer,
 and will go back to white collar DEFENSE. As the mother of a young 
woman interested in law, I find myself wondering where is Ms. Ruemmler’s
 MORAL COMPASS? How can you go from prosecuting white collar crime to 
defending it? Clearly the latter pays more and uses similar detailed 
expertise. But does getting close to all that detail just obscure the 
line between </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>right</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>and </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>wrong</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">? So with you, does the daily crush of details obscure what the<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>largest long-term crisis on the planet</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">
 IS? Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline Right NOW. Don’t get 
distracted from the climate crisis. If we irreversibly damage the 
climate, nothing else matters. Keep your moral compass steady.</font></p>

<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">Thank you to Henry Fountain for the long article on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) today. </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/science/corralling-carbon-before-it-belches-from-stack.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/science/corralling-carbon-before-it-belches-from-stack.html</a></font></p>
<font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>
<p><font style="font-size: 12px;">More people need to know more about 
this technology. But the article is misleading in a number of ways. 
First the 1 million tons of CO2 per year that Norway stores under sea 
sounds like a large amount, but is TINY. Second, selling CO2 to use to 
pump more </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>oil</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>(enhanced oil recovery) just creates MORE CO2 to get rid of!! Third, saying the technology is </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>known</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><font style="font-size: 12px;"> </font>is
 like saying building a cabin is like building a skyscraper! CCS is a 
bad idea built on man’s hubris. Some think we can just engineer our way 
out of anything! The only good news in the article is that the high 
development costs of CCS are keeping its proliferation to a slow </font><font style="font-size: 12px;"><b>crawl</b></font><font style="font-size: 12px;">. Hopefully we will realize our tech skills are better used developing renewable energy than CCS.</font><span>&nbsp; </span><font style="font-size: 12px;">Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline NOW!

Letter # 421<br>
<br>
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I love the Justin Gillis headline from 29 April: “What does Today Owe Tomorrow?” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/science/what-does-today-owe-tomorrow.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/science/what-does-today-owe-tomorrow.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">His article is mostly about 
economists and the different amounts they are willing to spend to head 
off climate damage: from nothing to a great deal. Not surprisingly most 
economists come down somewhere in the middle, sort of like buying a 
mid-range insurance policy. But the question is philosophic and 
cultural. As corporations have gained power in the last decades in the </span><span style="font-family: arial;">US</span><span style="font-family: arial;">,
 so too has net worth TODAY become the Holy Grail of this 
hyper-capitalism. There is no room in quarterly profit statements, in 
split-second derivatives trading, and in one-click internet shopping for
 thoughts of tomorrow. But I personally feel I owe tomorrow <u>a great deal</u>.
 I do what I can to goad you and others into action to lessen climate 
change due to CARBON EMISSIONS! And I will keep speaking out. Please 
stop the Keystone XL pipeline as a first small step to limit climate 
change. I see myself as part of a long chain of humans – a chain I would
 like to see continue and <u>flourish</u>. We stand on the shoulders of many. The future health of the planet is worth fighting for.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: arial;"></span>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"> <br>
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Last month Paul Krugman wrote a column supporting your new EPA rules on carbon emissions and stating that this </span><span style="font-family: arial;">US</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> policy would have a positive effect on </span><span style="font-family: arial;">China</span><span style="font-family: arial;">, encouraging them to cut emissions too. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/opinion/krugman-the-climate-domino.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/opinion/krugman-the-climate-domino.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Nice happy talk – good for 
dispelling doom and gloom – but frankly over-stating the importance of 
these paltry new rules. Today just the opposite seems to be happening: </span><span style="font-family: arial;">China</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> is planning 50 coal gasification plants by 2030. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/world/asia/greenpeace-says-chinas-energy-plans-exacerbate-climate-change.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/world/asia/greenpeace-says-chinas-energy-plans-exacerbate-climate-change.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">These water-intensive plants will 
be built in the deserts of Xinjiang increasing coal use and carbon 
emissions there, in order to reduce them in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Beijing</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> and </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Tianjin</span><span style="font-family: arial;">. </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Beijing</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> gets cleaner air at the expense of the <b>air</b> and <b>water</b>
 of Xinjiang! The net result is MORE CARBON EMISSIONS. These plans are 
detailed in a recent report by Greenpeace East Asia. I thank them for 
reporting.</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> I can’t do much to change </span><span style="font-family: arial;">China</span><span style="font-family: arial;">’s
 misguided energy plans, but that is all the more reason to ask YOU to 
please stop the Keystone XL pipeline NOW! Remember we need to cut our 
carbon emissions by 4% this year!! How are we going to do it?</span>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It staggered along for 8 years – but under the combined vitriol of <u>mining companies</u> (Australia is one of the world’s biggest producers), <u>Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers</u> (82% of news articles on the tax were NEGATIVE) and <u>conservative politicians</u> (funded by the first two!) it died on July 17<sup>th</sup>.
 The old argument of the economy over the environment triumphed in spite
 of the facts. To me, particularly chilling is the role the newspapers 
played. People are fickle – public opinion acts a bit like a breeze 
blowing around in a wheat-field – tossing the plants this way and that. 
Murdoch was like a steady chilling wind from one direction – a voice 
full of lies and fear-mongering. So hooray to the </span><span style="font-family: arial;">USA</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> where the press is <u>more</u> free and more than one voice can be heard. But we can’t congratulate ourselves too much. We’ve <b>never</b>
 had a carbon “emissions trading scheme.” Please stop the Keystone XL 
pipeline TODAY. Send a strong message. Give the press some good news to 
report: that the </span><span style="font-family: arial;">US</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> President ACTS on the urgency of climate change!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Thank you.</span></p>

<br>
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I am deeply saddened at how little </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Europe</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> is willing to do to sanction </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Russia</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> for over-running the </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Ukraine</span><span style="font-family: arial;">. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/world/europe/europeans-to-debate-tougher-sanctions-on-russia.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/world/europe/europeans-to-debate-tougher-sanctions-on-russia.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Russia</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> has been supporting the break-away rebels in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Ukraine</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> for at least 5 months, and Flight 17 was shot down 2 weeks ago, killing 200 Dutch. Because </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Europe</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> needs Russian gas and oil, they are loath to act. Shell is one of </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Russia</span><span style="font-family: arial;">’s largest foreign investors and Shell is the largest company in the </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Netherlands</span><span style="font-family: arial;">. If Shell loses money, every pension fund in the </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Netherlands</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> loses money. </span><span style="font-family: arial;">France</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> sells arms to </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Russia</span><span style="font-family: arial;">, so doesn’t want sanctions in that sector. So today we read that sanctions against bank loans are starting “to curb </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Russia</span><span style="font-family: arial;">’s long term ability to develop new oil resources”!! <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/europe/european-sanctions-russia.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/europe/european-sanctions-russia.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">So GOLLY GEE – we won’t lend them 
any more money, but they can still fund their future fossil fuel 
projects with money Europe PAYS for oil and gas. We won’t lend money for
 more lemons, but we will keep buying the lemonade! This is really 
disappointing. The real solution here is to let Shell lose some money 
and to quickly get </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Europe</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> <u>and the </u></span><u><span style="font-family: arial;">US</span></u><span style="font-family: arial;">
 off fossil fuels. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline. The world 
petro-economy is making us make terrible decisions EVERYWHERE.</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Wednesday I went to a city council hearing on a petition asking the City of </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Cambridge</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> to have the <u>City Council vote</u>
 on each building permit for LARGE buildings for the next two years. The
 city is growing rapidly and is working on a master plan to define how 
and where big developments should be happening. But meanwhile each 
building is getting approved without looking at it in the <u>context</u> of the whole city. Developers are rushing ahead helter-skelter!! The public comment (overwhelmingly in favor of City <br>
Council controlling building permits), went on so long there will be 
another meeting to continue deliberation in September. Let’s hope the 
City Council steps up to their civic responsibility to take control of 
the process. And I ask you to STEP UP to your national responsibility to
 take control of our energy future. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline
 NOW! and put lots more money into renewables.</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> Thank you.</span>

<br>
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I write today to honor Dr. Sheik Umar Khan of </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Sierra Leone</span><span style="font-family: arial;">. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/africa/sierra-leone-leading-doctor-dies-of-ebola.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/africa/sierra-leone-leading-doctor-dies-of-ebola.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">He was the head doctor in charge of
 the Ebola outbreak there and lost his life in trying to save others. 
There is so much fear that many nurses are running away, leaving just a 
handful of doctors and others to care for many. When countries get 
gripped by terrible diseases, officials have no time to consider climate
 change. That makes is all the more important for us fortunate ones to 
do what we can NOW to lessen the terrible future impact of climate 
change on us all. So please please stop the Keystone XL pipeline and 
take that first small step towards climate responsibility. You really 
need to do what you can to make sure the earth has a flourishing climate
 50 and 100 years from now. We <b>know</b> the science, so please act quickly on that science.</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> Thank you.</span>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Last night I went to a superb student production of Ionesco’s <u>Rhinoceros</u> at the Loeb Theater. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/85104cf123a3dd1ce267db2d43d28afa.jpg" width="268" height="418"></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The principal role Berenger was 
played by David Sheynberg and I hope that he goes on to a career of 
great success. He certainly deserves to. The play, a classic of Theater 
of the Absurd, chronicles the transformation, one by one, of the 
townspeople into rhinoceros who thunder off in a herd. The first to 
succumb is the most self-righteous and egotistical and at the end only 
Berenger remains: empathetic, questioning, full of self-doubt. So maybe 
I’m wrong about climate change – maybe it won’t be as catastrophic as I 
fear. There is never certainty about the future. But so few people are 
willing to tackle long term problems, that I’ll just keep reminding you 
of how URGENT climate change is, until I can figure out something more 
important to do. Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline! Stop it NOW! Show
 empathy for future generations and show the courage to not follow the 
herd.</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> Thank you.</span>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Severe weather has hit </span><span style="font-family: arial;">South Asia</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> this past week with a deadly mudslide in Malin </span><span style="font-family: arial;">India</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> and another a few days later in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Nepal</span><span style="font-family: arial;">.</span> <span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/world/asia/otherworldly-downpour-preceded-landslide-in-india.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/world/asia/otherworldly-downpour-preceded-landslide-in-india.html</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The Malin storm was particularly terrifying. Villages reported heavier rain than <b>they had ever seen</b>
 followed by a crash and less than a minute of “a downpour so heavy it 
could not be called rain.” Then most of the houses were gone. One can 
only say once again: severe weather disruption!! How many more freak 
storms before people realize the role of CARBON EMISSIONS on the world’s
 weather patterns? We need immediate action to curb carbon emissions. </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Please stop the Keystone XL pipeline to show you care. Typhoon Haiyan, a half-year of rain in </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Sardinia</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> in a single day, and now this!

</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I write to you today about </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Toledo</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">’s toxic drinking water from </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Lake Erie</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/us/lifting-ban-toledo-says-its-water-is-safe-to-drink-again.html"><span style="font-family: arial;">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/us/lifting-ban-toledo-says-its-water-is-safe-to-drink-again.html</span></a> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">We cleaned </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Lake Erie</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;"> once, but have now let it sink into crisis again and a big part of the problem is <u>industrial agriculture</u>. The Fertilizer Institute has seen to it that there are <b>no</b> federal limits on <b>phosphorus </b>pollution, and in </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Ohio</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;"> the Agriculture lobby is so powerful a new law makes pollution control for farmers <b>voluntary</b>.
 They also saw to it that NO MENTION is made to CAFOs (concentrated 
animal feeding operations) in the law at all!! This is way out of 
balance. I would gladly pay a bit more for food and not have the 
nation’s <u>water</u> polluted by tons of <b>manure </b>in certain 
locations. That’s just not fair. Farmers need to clean up their messes 
just like everyone else - and that includes fertilizer run off and 
manure. And <b>you</b> need to help us clean up the carbon mess in the 
atmosphere! Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline! We don’t need it and 
it just will create more carbon pollution. Thank you. </span> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I continue the 
conversation about water pollution today and particularly want to talk 
about huge animal fed lots that have sprung up in the last 20 to 30 
years. They are called CAFO’s. The EPA has recently tried to define them
 and regulate their manure discharge as pollution. The definitions are 
here on the EPA website, and their intent was to regulate medium and 
large CAFOs.</span> <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-08/documents/cafo_permitmanual_chapter2.pdf"><span style="font-family: arial;">https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-08/documents/cafo_permitmanual_chapter2.pdf</span></a><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;"><span><br>
</span><br>
This means turkey forms with at least 16,500 <b>birds</b>, and egg 
producers with over 9000 chickens, and pigs farms with over 750 big 
pigs, or 3000 piglets. These are huge operations and of course they need
 to be regulated, because they have a terrible pollution record. Sadly, 
the EPA wields less power than the Ag lobby. The link to the EPS’s CAFO 
Rule goes to an <b>error </b>page </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/npdes/caforule"><span style="font-family: arial;">https://www.epa.gov/npdes/caforule</span></a>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">- and so it has been since 2012. Meanwhile, pollution continues apace. </span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">We are letting 
short-term commercial profit trump pollution both in agriculture and in 
the fossil fuel area. Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. You can do 
it with the stroke of a pen. The other tasks take more cooperation. 
Thank you. </span> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Letter #436</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I was dismayed to 
read that Colorado Gov. Hickenlooper cut a deal with Democratic Rep. 
Jared Polis to withdraw two anti fracking measures from the Nov. ballot 
in exchange for a Taskforce to study fracking and an end to the lawsuit 
against the town of </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Longmont</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">.</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/us/ballot-fight-on-drilling-is-avoided-in-colorado.html"><span style="font-family: arial;">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/us/ballot-fight-on-drilling-is-avoided-in-colorado.html</span></a> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">But it is important to see this action not only in the <u>national</u> context of Sen. Udall’s tight re-election race, but also in the <u>state</u>
 context where Republicans are hoping to take control of the Colorado 
state senate, and use that power to assist big oil and gas. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/politics/midterms-give-parties-chance-for-sweeping-control-of-states.html"><span style="font-family: arial;">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/us/politics/midterms-give-parties-chance-for-sweeping-control-of-states.html</span></a> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">As Matt Walter says: 
“The ability to restrain the other side from advancing their agenda very
 often comes down to a couple of seats in one chamber.” So I understand 
postponement until after the midterms, but after that, win or lose, 
environmentalists are going to get louder and more emphatic. Please Stop
 the Keystone XL Pipeline - <b>as soon as possible </b>- and no later 
than Thanksgiving! What is really most important here is the 
world-context. We cannot continue to ignore carbon pollution. We do so 
at our peril! Other local issues pale in comparison. Thank you. </span> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Here is Brad Plumer’s Card #4: How do we know humans are responsible for global warming? </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/how-do-we-know-humans-are-responsible-for-global-warming"><span style="font-family: arial;">https://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/how-do-we-know-humans-are-responsible-for-global-warming</span></a> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Well, we know 
greenhouse gases trap heat, and the evidence points to more CO2 and 
other GHG, and none of the alternate theories stack up: sun spots, 
volcanoes… the IPCC convened a huge group of scientists to work on this,
 and decided we are 95% certain that GHG use by humans has caused more 
than half the global warming since 1951. That’s pretty compelling. And 
Plumer gives you links to lots and lots details for those who want to 
dig deeper! So please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Plumer is doing his
 part educating people, you need to do <u>your part</u> by stopping that DIRTY dirty oil coming across the </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">USA</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">!</span> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Brad Plumer’s card #5 asks “Where do greenhouse gas emissions come from?” </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/where-do-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from"><span style="font-family: arial;">https://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/where-do-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from</span></a> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">65% come from burning
 fossil fuels and the rest come from changing land use and agriculture. 
He includes some links to some great charts <b>showing </b>who has contributed most to the emissions since 1850 and the breakdown for different countries. </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/22/6805513/un-climate-talks-in-seven-charts"><span style="font-family: arial;">https://www.vox.com/2014/9/22/6805513/un-climate-talks-in-seven-charts</span></a> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">The </span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">US</span><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">
 is one of the top 5 emitters today and has a long history of emissions.
 The responsible position for us is to try and cut back rapidly. Please 
start by stopping the Keystone XL Pipeline right now! Thank you.</span> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Wow, this card is Plumer’s #6 and its pretty powerful.

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">The next card #7 asks
 how high will temperatures rise if global warming continues - and the 
links here delve into the very interesting topic of “climate 
sensitivity”. </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/how-high-will-temperatures-rise-if-global-warming-continues"><span style="font-family: arial;">https://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/how-high-will-temperatures-rise-if-global-warming-continues</span></a> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">It’s not something we
 know a lot about, so conclusions are difficult but we probably don’t 
want to send the planet off on a warming binge hotter than we’ve seen in
 the last 6 or 7 ice ages! - We may not survive it very well. We do best
 when the climate doesn’t vary too much! So please Stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline! I’m worried we’ve started a trend that will be hard to stop.

<p><span style="font-family: times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Well Gov. Chris 
Christie is in Mexico touting a “North American energy renaissance” that
 sounds like a speech written for him by Big Oil. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/us/politics/in-speech-on-mexico-trip-gov-christie-lays-out-vision-for-energy-renaissance.html"><span>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/us/politics/in-speech-on-mexico-trip-gov-christie-lays-out-vision-for-energy-renaissance.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Well it probably was.
 His ideas about exporting crude to help the US economy prove he can see
 no farther than the end of his nose. And yet he brought his son Andrew 
with him to meet some important people. What sort of world climate does 
Mr. Christie think his son will live in in 40 years? What will 6 degrees
 of global warming do to the planet? I shudder to think! And Christie’s 
claim that the Keystone XL Pipeline would lower US energy prices is 
simply untrue. That oil is destined for <u>export</u> to Asia to enrich 
Canada - nothing more! So please show your wisdom and understanding of 
the dangers of climate change, and show your enduring love of your 
daughters and the world they will live in after we are gone! Please Stop
 the Keystone XL Pipeline right NOW! When we say a leader has <u>vision</u>,
 we mean long-sighted, someone who can see things clearly that are still
 a long way off. Show us your vision! Stop KXL. Thank you. </span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">BP is guilty of <u>gross negligence</u> in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/business/bp-negligent-in-2010-oil-spill-us-judge-rules.html"><span>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/business/bp-negligent-in-2010-oil-spill-us-judge-rules.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I applaud our justice
 system and Judge Carl J. Barbier for the ruling. But the real lesson 
here is that Big Oil is frequently reckless, motivated by profit and 
refuses to police itself. In this era of capitalism run amok, the only 
solution is <u>government regulation</u>. We need to <b>prevent</b> 
disasters, not mop up after them! Do not allow more oil drilling 
offshore and please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline! We do not need these 
dirty and dangerous projects. We need to quickly <span>wean</span>&nbsp;ourselves from fossil fuels. The oil industry cuts <span>corners<b> </b></span>to
 maximize profit and takes huge risks only to say afterwards “gee, I 
didn’t know!” Time and again they choose huge profit over environmental 
damage. The pattern is very clear. We count on you and other government 
officials to rein them in. Thank you. </span> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">A few weeks ago Alaska tried to repeal a sweetheart set of tax breaks for Big Oil. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/politics/sarah-palins-attack-on-sean-parnells-oil-plan-creates-odd-wedge-for-alaskan-voters.html"><span>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/politics/sarah-palins-attack-on-sean-parnells-oil-plan-creates-odd-wedge-for-alaskan-voters.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Even Sarah Palin 
thought it should be repealed - as giving away too much to oil 
companies. But Big oil campaigned hard in the usual way: we’ll create 
lots of jobs and if you don’t let us have this money we’ll go drill 
elsewhere - and once again money talked and big oil kept their tax 
breaks. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/us/alaskans-uphold-tax-system-for-oil-companies.html"><span>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/us/alaskans-uphold-tax-system-for-oil-companies.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">It was close - but 
the bad guys won. More carbon pollution is on its way! We just can’t go 
on like this, ignoring the damage to the climate as it relentlessly 
mounts! Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. We don’t need it and we <b>need</b> to keep that oil <b>in the ground</b>.
 What will future generations say of us? Say of your leadership? Why is 
carbon pollution not on everyone’s mind, on the tip of every tongue? 
There are plenty of other ways to get energy to power our lives - we 
just need to invest in them. Please help us turn US energy policy 
around. NO to fossil fuels, YES to Renewable Energy. Thank you. </span> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I loved the article in June about rooftop solar investments for renters and such. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/business/energy-environment/buying-into-solar-power-no-roof-access-needed.html"><span>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/business/energy-environment/buying-into-solar-power-no-roof-access-needed.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Community solar 
projects on local industrial buildings are good for everyone. I just 
found out that Cambridge has a new company in this domain:</span><span style="font-family: arial;"> Potluck Energy.</span> <span style="font-family: arial; color: black;"><a href="https://potluckenergy.com/"><span>https://potluckenergy.com/</span></a> I wish them luck and I hope to see lots of community rooftop solar projects sprouting up around town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Meanwhile please say 
NO to the Keystone XL Pipeline! It's important that you take a firm

<p><span style="font-family: times;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Today in Fall River, 
MA Ken Ward and Jay O’Hara were on trial for their lobster boat action 
last May 15th when they blocked 40,000 tons of coal from being unloaded 
at Brayton Point Power Station. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/us/charges-dropped-against-climate-activists.html"><span>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/us/charges-dropped-against-climate-activists.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">They risked prison to
 stand up and protect our climate and about 100 people came to their 
trial this morning to support them. The good news is the case was 
quickly dismissed with just a fine of $200 to cover police expense. The 
bad news is shutting Brayton Point by 2017 <u>isn’t soon enough</u>. We need to be reducing emissions <u>10 times faster</u>
 than currently! That’s huge. We need you to take charge and lead the 
way. Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today as a sign of your 
commitment to quickly reducing carbon emissions. Thank you. </span> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I was delighted to see this morning that DA Sam Sutter’s dismissal of the lobster boat trial yesterday made <b>front page news</b> in the Boston Globe! <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/08/activists-drops-charges-case-blocked-coal-shipment-power-plant/sUpBpGxzxAz3E2Vr5RFQQM/story.html"><span>https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/08/activists-drops-charges-case-blocked-coal-shipment-power-plant/sUpBpGxzxAz3E2Vr5RFQQM/story.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">They ran a photo of 
DA Sutter clutching a copy of a Bill Mckibben article as he left the 
courthouse. Sutter made a statement to the press: “Climate change is one
 of the gravest crises our planet has ever faced. In my humble opinion, 
the political leadership on this issue has been sorely lacking.“ Please 
take Mr. Sutter’s actions and words to heart. Please Stop the Keystone 
XL Pipeline immediately! We need to move much faster towards reducing

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I read with sadness 
the article about Katherine Weymouth, the last member of the venerable 
Graham family, leaving the Washington Post. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/business/Katharine-Weymouth-publisher-of-The-Washington-Post-will-resign.html"><span>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/business/Katharine-Weymouth-publisher-of-The-Washington-Post-will-resign.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Mr. Bezos certainly 
knows about marketing, but he seems to know little about the great 
social good that newspapers have performed for centuries. Bezos’ answer 
to shrinking readership is to focus on “the user and future user and 
how, where, and how often they engage.” Internet users engage most often
 with stupid cat videos, or salacious celebrity photos. This will sell 
ads, but does nothing to inform the public. The climate deniers in this 
country must be thrilled at this new degradation of the Washington Post.
 So before<a name="_GoBack"></a> they achieve even more power, please 
STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline! Stop it right now. Great leaders can 
perform great social good too! Here is your chance. Thank you. </span> </p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I write today to honor rain forest 
activist Edwin Chota and his 3 colleagues who were brutally murdered 
last week near Saweto, Peru while returning home. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/world/americas/peru-4-opponents-of-illegal-logging-are-found-dead.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/world/americas/peru-4-opponents-of-illegal-logging-are-found-dead.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Chota has been active and vocal for years against <u>illegal logging</u>
 and has received many death threats from loggers. I guess this time 
they got him. The Ashaninka people along the Tamaya River have been 
working for YEARS to obtain title to their lands, to protect them for 
all of us and for the planet. But corruption and greed give the loggers 
the upper hand.<span>&nbsp; </span><span style="color: black;">Please 
Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline in honor of these brave environmentalists.
 Let’s shift the balance – leave the oil in the ground and let the 
rainforest thrive. With wise choices, we can avoid tremendous climate 
disruption – but we need BOLD ACTION Right NOW.</span></span></p>

 voted for Don Berwick for Governor. He didn’t win and I will vote 
democratic in November, but I’m very glad I voted for him. He cares 
about poverty and hunger and children and would have made a great 
Governor. Maybe next time. I find myself frequently wondering how to get
 people to understand the connection between social justice and climate 
justice. When disasters strike it is always the poor, the old, the 
infirm who bear the greatest burden. You could set us on a path to <u>fewer climate disasters</u> Right NOW! <span style="color: black;">Please

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This week I was part of a 
delegation from 350MA (Massachusetts) to a meeting with State Rep. 
Denise Provost on ways to support her in her efforts to speed reductions
 in GHG. One big stumbling block is the power of lobbyists for Big Oil. 
Rep. Provost showed <u>Gasland II</u> at lunch at the State House and 
then Steve Dodge of the American Petroleum Institute sent this letter to
 all her colleagues. Rep. Provost called him twice and asked for his 
“independently verified information” but she is still waiting to receive
 it! He has no such info. He is blowing smoke. But is paid plenty to 
work this State House as are others in every other state. So put your 
pen on the side of a healthy climate for our planet. <span style="color: black;">Please

Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">As I was marching in New York on Sunday, Turkey was closing its border with Syria. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/world/europe/over-130000-flee-syria-for-turkey-in-wake-of-isis-raids.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/world/europe/over-130000-flee-syria-for-turkey-in-wake-of-isis-raids.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The US attacks on ISIS inside Syria
 has sent at least 150,000 Kurds streaming towards the Turkish border in
 hopes of safety. The Turks responded by closing border crossings. 
Refugees lined up near the fence, some with their goats and sheep, who 
they said, would die of thirst if left behind. This is a long drawn-out 
conflict exacerbated by years of drought and climate disruption. The 
Turkish side of the border also suffers from years of drought – so the 
Turks try to keep scarce resources (ie. WATER) for themselves. This 
picture of human misery is not just about religious fanaticism, but also
 <b>climate disruption</b>. Can’t you see the connection?<span>&nbsp; </span>Too
 many people in too harsh a climate. We are going to see more and more 
of this misery as we continue to pump GHG into our atmosphere. <span style="color: black;">Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline RIGHT NOW to send a strong message that we must stop carbon emissions as quickly as we can.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I didn’t know much about palm oil, 
except no one used it 20 years ago or 30, so I went to the Union of 
Concerned Scientists website <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/palm-oil-and-global-warming.pdf">https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/palm-oil-and-global-warming.pdf</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">and learned:</span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="font-family: arial;">we have doubled world production of palm oil since 2000 to 500 million metric tons</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial;">growth is largely driven by increased demand for vegetable oil, Westerners wanting to avoid trans-fat, <u>cheap labor and land</u></span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial;">Indonesia is second in deforestation – right behind Brazil</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial;">Indonesia plans to double palm oil production by 2020.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">So the UN decision to <u>NOT increase</u> deforestation is TOO WEAK. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://mashable.com/2014/09/27/united-nations-climate-summit-deforestation/#aQ0VK6Dp9Oqx">https://mashable.com/2014/09/27/united-nations-climate-summit-deforestation/#aQ0VK6Dp9Oqx</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">We have already deforested too 
much. Palm oil is NOT CHEAP if you count the environmental damage, the 
carbon emissions from burning peat bogs, and the social and health costs
 to Indonesia and Malaysia! Here again we see a commodity price that is 
too low for a healthy planet. <span style="color: black;">Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Show you are serious about the COST of <b>carbon pollution</b> and want a healthy and sustainable climate for all.</span> <span style="color: black;">Thank you. </span></span></p>

take swift local action. I showed them the dripping FUTURE picture I

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">These 7 acres of upland woods lie 
right up against the Alewife Wetlands and between the towns of Cambridge
 and Belmont. A developer is going to put up 200 units of housing. He 
has owned the land a long time, but if the towns could rezone it today, 
they wouldn’t let anything be built there. We now know that we need this
 land for flood protection from storms that are going to get worse. But 
we didn’t know it back when it was zoned. Maybe if enough people 
demonstrate we can pressure the owner to sell. It’s unlikely, but at 
least worth a try. So we held a vigil on the side of a busy road in the 
gloaming, as cars went by. Trees are easy to cut down and take a long 
time to grow. Habitats and ecosystems are complex and we destroy too 
many of them and then spend millions on wetlands restoration and such. 
Sheer FOLLY! So <span style="color: black;">Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. We don’t need it, it will leak and pollute aquifers. Just say NO to it NOW. Thank you. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It’s nice that top-name musicians 
donated their time and talents for yesterday’s Global Poverty Project’s 
concert in Central Park.</span> <span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/arts/music/global-citizen-festival-brings-stars-to-central-park.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/arts/music/global-citizen-festival-brings-stars-to-central-park.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>&nbsp;</span>It drew 60,000 
people. But they will never wipe out extreme poverty by 2030 if they 
don’t join the fight against climate change! On Tuesday the UN announced
 that lack of money was forcing it to reduce ration packets for Syrians 
by 40%. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>&nbsp;</span>UN rations have 
been cut all over the world by similar amounts, while “demand worldwide 
continues to grow with new crises.” Climate change tears the social 
fabric of weak nations, shredding the safety net for millions. As carbon
 pollution rises in the next decades (from all the GHG we have <u>already</u>
 pumped into the air), drought and desertification will affect more and 
more people, while floods ravage others. We must turn this trend around 
QUICKLY!<span>&nbsp; </span><span style="color: black;">Please Stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. Make a personal statement to the world that Barack
 Obama knows that climate change hits hardest at the POOR, the weak, 
dashing them from poverty into EXTREME POVERTY. Fighting climate change

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Three large – well <u>huge</u> really – ethanol factories are opening in the Midwest, </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">planning to consume 
hundreds of thousands of tons of corn “stover” – stalks and leaves – to 
produce 20 to 30 million gallons of ethanol a year. But the industry 
depends on US <u>corn subsidies</u> and federal requirements adding 
ethanol to vehicle fuel. It’s also not at all clear that “better 
management of crop residue” ie., stripping all mulch off the land, is <u>better</u>
 at all. And who is investing in ethanol? Royal Dutch and Dupont who see
 profit in chemicals. We really need to stop the government subsidies of
 this misguided industry. Once again we are not counting the external 
costs to the land, to the bees, to the complex interplay of natural 
balanced systems. I doubt that a more nuanced and complex analysis of 
this ethanol industry would find it “carbon neutral!” The better way to 
lessen climate change is <u>renewable</u> energy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline and pour government ethanol subsidies into <u>renewable energy subsidies</u>. Now there’s a promising future for all Americans! Thank you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I was happy to see a 
full page ad calling for carbon pricing last week.[Note: It was paid for
 by EDF, GDF, Suez and Statoil, but a UN group Caring for Climate put 
their name to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;"><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/d2f83417781ec5e27155e192cfaad21c.jpg" width="190" height="99"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">The signatories are mostly European gas and energy companies who will benefit competitively from carbon pricing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;"><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/b4282326a5020a2d887ec550af5efced.jpg" width="568" height="498"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">But we must be 
cautious with our enthusiasm. These are huge multi-national companies 
with fingers in many pies. Abengoa – who is that? I just saw their name 
yesterday! oh yes – a Spanish energy company that has invested heavily 
in concentrated solar and <u>ethanol</u>. They see profits to be made in <u>chemicals</u> from ethanol. So we think this ad shows that carbon pricing is <u>really going to happen</u>!
 That’s great. But let’s be sure not to hand out too many subsidies to 
the wrong people in the process! We really want to support simple local 
renewables, not huge extractive ethanol factories with “valuable” 
chemical byproducts. Keep it simple. Keep it low impact! A first great 
step is to Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline Stop it now. And let’s be 
careful who we subsidize! Thank you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">WGBH purports to be 
the best TV-science provider with shows like NOVA. But David Koch 
supports climate-change DENIAL! Something is so discordant in this 
juxtaposition that I just had to chime in! Koch has given over $16 
million to WGBH in the past 15 or so years, and $10 million of that has 
been to NOVA. They want that funding and convince themselves of the 
great public good the money provides. I’m not so sure. Nova packages 
science in fancy glossy wrappers to make it more entertaining and 
attract larger audiences. Maybe glossy isn’t better. And glossy stories 
from Big Oil about the benefits of “cheap oil” are just a pack of lies. 
We will pay a HUGE environmental and climate price for those lies. 
Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline RIGHT NOW! Let’s switch rapidly to 
renewables. Thank you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">September was not a 
great month. There were so many events that I somehow got overwhelmed. 
So I’ll try to mention some of them now. Today I write in honor of 
Sameera Salih Ali al-Nauimy. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/world/middleeast/womens-rights-activist-executed-by-islamic-state-in-iraq.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/world/middleeast/womens-rights-activist-executed-by-islamic-state-in-iraq.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">She was an Iraqi 
lawyer who promoted women’s rights and condemned the brutality of ISIS. 
She was tortured and publically executed. The UN reported her death and 
those of other women recently stating that “educated professional women”
 are particularly at risk. There is a tremendous overlap, particularly 
in poor countries, of women’s rights, human rights, and climate rights. 
Killing the leaders of these movements is horrendous, but will not end 
activism. I would argue that the very best thing you can do for these 
millions of women is to <u>act</u> quickly to stop climate change. Climate change causes scarce water and <u>wars</u>.
 To lessen wars, we need to lessen climate change! In honor of Ms. 
al-Nauimy and other activists Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Show
 you are serious about protecting our planet from further damage. Thank 
you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I was happy to read Michael Brune’s recent blog post that the Norwegian giant energy company <u>Statoil</u> has abandoned its Alberta Tar Sands project. <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-brune/if-a-tar-sands-project-fa_b_5917136.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-brune/if-a-tar-sands-project-fa_b_5917136.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Hooray – by stopping 
Keystone XL thus far, we have stopped one more awful dirty tar sands 
project because it is too costly. There are better ways for Statoil to 
make money!<span>&nbsp; </span>Hooray Hooray Hooray! As climate change 
continues, more and more companies will realize that fossil fuels need 
to stay in the ground! I just wish we could push that realization along 
faster. It would be better for us all! So please pick up your pen and 
Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY! Send your clear message that <u>clean energy</u> is the profit-maker of the future. Thank you, and thank you to Statoil for making a good decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Susan J. Ringler, Hooray for one less Tar Sands Project</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Note: and in Dec 2016 they sold all their Tar Sands assets too! <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/statoils-exit-starkest-sign-canadas-oilsands-resource-has-lost-its-lustre">http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/statoils-exit-starkest-sign-canadas-oilsands-resource-has-lost-its-lustre</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I was thrilled to read that the Rockefeller Family foundation (Rockefeller Brothers Fund) is divesting from fossil fuels! <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/us/heirs-to-an-oil-fortune-join-the-divestment-drive.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/us/heirs-to-an-oil-fortune-join-the-divestment-drive.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Good for them. I’m 
sure they can make just as much money with other investments. I thank 
Steven Rockefeller for saying he sees financial trouble ahead for 
companies that have stockpiled more fossil fuel <u>reserves</u> than 
they can burn without significant damage to the climate. Those assets 
will become worthless! Having a foundation of this stature join the 
divestment movement will impel Yale to do more than just <u>ask</u> its investors to “avoid” certain investments </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/business/yale-fund-takes-aim-at-climate-change.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/business/yale-fund-takes-aim-at-climate-change.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">and hopefully will 
bring Harvard into the conversation as well. These moves also make more 
capital available for renewable energy of all types! So please follow 
the Rockefellers’ lead! They don’t see a future in more Tar Sands and 
more pipelines! So Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today! Right 
NOW! You can do this! Pick up that pen! Thank you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I write in support of Ilham Tohti, a Uighur professor of Economics whom the Chinese just sentenced to <b>life in prison</b> for supposed “separatism.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/world/asia/china-court-sentences-uighur-scholar-to-life-in-separatism-case.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/world/asia/china-court-sentences-uighur-scholar-to-life-in-separatism-case.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">I know you protested 
his treatment and thank you for that. The Chinese declared that Prof. 
Tohti “bewitched and coerced young ethnic students” to work on his 
website. They presented videotaped jailhouse confessions of 3 students 
denouncing their former professor. These are 3 of 7 students who 
vanished in January – at the time of Prof. Tohti’s arrest. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/world/asia/3-Missing-Chinese-Students-Surface-to-Denounce-Uighur-Tohti.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/world/asia/3-Missing-Chinese-Students-Surface-to-Denounce-Uighur-Tohti.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">To the Chinese, 
Xinjiang is just a desert full of valuable resources to be extracted: 
pastures turned into mines, herders forcibly resettled, When will we 
learn that the “cheap” fuels and minerals so extracted are NOT <b>cheap</b>? The environmental and social costs are huge. The Chinese are trampling the environment and trampling the Uighurs, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/opinion/nicholas-bequelin-china-jailing-of-ilham-tohti-will-radicalize-more-uighurs.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/opinion/nicholas-bequelin-china-jailing-of-ilham-tohti-will-radicalize-more-uighurs.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">but we only have one 
planet and cannot afford to trample it all. Some Chinese discount 
Uighurs as backwards, but I honor them for fighting on the front line of
 climate change as do many other indigenous peoples. Please Stop the

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Dear President Obama,</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">Between the Ebola 
epidemic in Africa and the ISIS extremists in the Middle East, there is 
scant room for environmental problems in the media these days. But the 
climate crisis is so <b>urgent</b> that nothing else will matter if we 
don’t act quickly and decisively to cut carbon emissions. Brazil had a 
presidential election last weekend, and there was some hope that Marina 
Silva, an environmental leader, would make it to the run-offs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/world/americas/brazil-rainforest-amazon-conservation-election-rousseff-silva.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/world/americas/brazil-rainforest-amazon-conservation-election-rousseff-silva.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">That, alas, did not 
happen and so Brazil will choose between Rousseff who has failed to 
protect the Amazon (choosing instead huge mines and dams) and the 
pro-business Mr. Neves who would probably allow faster clear-cutting! 
Brazil slowed the pace of clear-cutting somewhat, but it increased 29% 
from 2012 to 2013! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: black;">This short-term extractive strategy to boost Brazil’s economy will end badly for Brazil and the <b>climate</b>!
 Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY! We owe it to the world to 
take the best actions we can. Our economy will manage just fine without 
Keystone XL! So STOP it NOW!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">a good thought for today with such 
intransigent hatred and fighting in the Middle East. But again, I would 
like to plead for urgent action on GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions. Part 
of the recent conflict is over the scant WATER resources. If you can

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Several recent articles have described GM’s faulty ignition switch, causing them to recall 2.6 million cars. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/business/after-a-gm-recall-a-fiery-crash-and-a-payout.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/business/after-a-gm-recall-a-fiery-crash-and-a-payout.html</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Lara Gass died last March in one of those cars, but what I find really unconscionable is GM’s claim (then and <u>now</u>)
 that the cars are “safe to drive if all objects are removed from the 
key chain”!! Are you kidding me? Anyone with more than one key puts them
 together – so as not to lose them – house keys, office keys, car keys -
 that’s what a key ring IS! It is completely irresponsible for GM to 
claim safety for its product if used in a way NO ONE DOES! It is also 
completely irresponsible to pretend that baby step reductions of GHG 
will be enough to limit climate change sufficiently. Please STOP the 
Keystone XL Pipeline right NOW. We cannot afford more delays. The 
climate crisis is urgent. We need swift action now. History will judge 
GM harshly for their safety record. Please act swiftly so history does 
not judge YOU harshly for your climate record! Do what you can 
IMMEDIATELY. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I write to you today about 
“synthetic biology.” I’m not sure if it’s any different from 
“bio-engineering” – just a different name. Solazyme changed the DNA of 
an algae – and made it produce oil – lots of it. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/business/biofuel-tools-applied-to-household-soaps.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/business/biofuel-tools-applied-to-household-soaps.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Unilever is buying 3 million 
gallons for soaps and lotions. Solazyme and Unilever both position 
themselves as rain forest protectors because the oil replaces palm oil. 
You have to feed the algae to make it produce oil, so Unilever is 
partnering with a huge Brazilian sugar cane grower. But are huge tracts 
of sugar cane to feed algae, to make oil, any more ecological than huge 
tracts of palm for palm oil? There are lots of natural oils in the 
world. They vary in <u>price</u>. The companies are doing this for <b>profit</b>
 – not to benefit the environment. They are not telling the consumers 
the whole story. I don’t think they are reducing greenhouse gases, or 
helping the climate. Profit, profit, profit! Greed, greed, greed! Please
 Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW! There’s a direct action which WILL 
have a good effect on our climate – yes a small one – but at least 
unambiguous!!! We need to respect nature and the incredible biodiversity
 of our fertile planet. Huge monoculture tracts do not respect 
biodiversity. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Letter #473</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I return today to the Uighers, for whom my heart goes out. Perhaps it is my favorite childhood book, <u>Big Tiger and Christian</u> (about which I wrote in <a href="http://www.imaginevividly.com/Climate_Action_Letters.php#lett84">letter #84</a>)
 that gives me such sympathy for them. These nomadic people lived on 
land we would consider harsh and did not destroy it. But China does not 
appreciate their stubborn resilience. Five years ago China started 
“modernizing” old Kashgar </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/world/asia/china-remodels-an-ancient-silk-road-city-and-an-ethnic-rift-widens.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/world/asia/china-remodels-an-ancient-silk-road-city-and-an-ethnic-rift-widens.html</a>
 – they tore down 65,000 homes and forcibly resettled 220,000 Uighers. 
The houses have been replaced with “new buildings made to look old” – 
only wealthier Uighers can afford to live here now. The new Chinese 
“zero-tolerance” policy allows police to use deadly force against 
protesters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/world/asia/chinas-leader-lays-out-plan-to-pacify-restive-region.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/world/asia/chinas-leader-lays-out-plan-to-pacify-restive-region.html</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">No wonder violence is escalating. 
In September, 3 Uighers were sentenced to DEATH for the March attack in 
Kumming train station where 29 were killed. Also in September, a crowd 
in Bugur raided a local police station complaining of <u>forced evictions</u>, lobbing some Molotov cocktails. 50 people are dead. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/world/asia/death-toll-in-xinjiang-violence-may-be-higher-than-reported.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/world/asia/death-toll-in-xinjiang-violence-may-be-higher-than-reported.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">No doubt more Uighers will pay 
heavily. Over and over again we see INDIGINEOUS peoples are better 
stewards of Nature than Colonizers! Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline
 NOW! Show that the US <u>can</u> respect the environment and is <b>serious</b> about reducing GHG emissions! Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I read a lovely obituary of Alastair Reid recently. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/arts/alastair-reid-a-restless-poet-and-essayist-is-dead-at-88.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/arts/alastair-reid-a-restless-poet-and-essayist-is-dead-at-88.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I love his book <u>Ounce, Dice, Trice</u>
 full of wonderful words to say out loud and clever sly illustrations by
 Ben Shahn. I send you here page 7, one of my favorites. The pictures 
and the words complement each other, each page is carefully laid out. 
This is truly a multi-media project. Too bad someone didn’t make a video
 of this book last year where we could <u>hear</u> Alastair Reid 
speaking each word. Now he has died. Wonderful things happen when 
creative and caring people come together. Climate change is a <b>huge</b>
 challenge but we can change to a non-fossil-fuel economy and continue 
with great resilience. Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline as a first <u>important step</u>
 away from carbon pollution. Let’s find inspiration and hope in the best
 creative minds of our times. Just as the words and pictures on these 
pages interact, so we need to build economic and social systems where 
humans and nature can interact to the detriment of neither. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Oiiiii!! I slipped on some wet 
leaves and fell and broke my right wrist in 3 places. Am in a splint and
 am scheduled for surgery on 29 October – will need one titanium plate, 
maybe 2, and will be in a cast for at least a month.<span>&nbsp; </span>So
 I will be unable to send you hand-written letters for a while. But I 
will continue writing. Today I want to mention the terrific news that 
the Pentagon considers climate change a CURRENT “threat demanding 
immediate action.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/pentagon-says-global-warming-presents-immediate-security-threat.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/pentagon-says-global-warming-presents-immediate-security-threat.html</a>? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This is a big change from a very 
conservative organization and I welcome their considerable influence in 
dealing with the mounting problems caused by our failure to confront 
climate change! Let’s hope we stop using fossil fuels <b>very soon</b>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">So please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline right now. Show you’re as conservative as the Pentagon!! The 
truly conservative response to climate change is to try and stop carbon 
emissions very rapidly. Stopping KXL is a small step in the right 
direction. Do it NOW.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/25c7ed05e6ba5ae254d69528bb2c7c0d.jpg" width="244" height="318"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">One-finger typing stinks. Surgery 
went well, but took several hours and left me wiped out. Am in a splint 
and off the prescription pain medicine, so doing better. I don’t do pain
 well. happy I needed only one titanium plate, but it will be an awkward
 month.<span>&nbsp; </span>Today I handed out flyers at a subway stop for 2 questions on the Mass ballot: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">NO on 1, so we can leave the gas tax indexed to inflation and get money fot fixing bridges and better public transit. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">YES on 2, so we can charge 5 cent deposit on water and juice bottles (not just carbonated drinks) and recycle more of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It’s amazing how many people avoid 
looking at you when you say “Are you voting?” and offer a small flyer. 
But I handed out 100 in an hour this evening – with one hand in a sling -
 and went home tired, but happy to have tried to get information to 
people.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both of these issues are important for our 
fight to limit climate change, but the local TV news had no info on them
 today. That covered only the MA governor race which they say is close, 
and the NH senate race – also close. But democracy is bigger than that. 
And money from special interests pours in and spreads mis-information. 
Free and fair elections? I’m not so sure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This article today worries me – the
 IPCC summary says “governments are spending another $600 billion or so 
directly subsidizing the consumption of fossil fuels. By contrast, the 
report found, less than $400 billion a year is being spent around the 
world to reduce emissions or otherwise cope with climate change.” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/world/europe/global-warming-un-intergovernmental-panel-on-climate-change.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/world/europe/global-warming-un-intergovernmental-panel-on-climate-change.html</a>?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">So please stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline right now. Show you know how stark our future looks if we don’t
 sharply reduce carbon emissions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do it NOW.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Most memorable reply was 30-ish

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In November, with my broken wrist, I signed an on-line petition against the Keystone XL Pipeline initiated by <b>leftaction.com</b>. I added this comment to you:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">“Please please -no kxl - I've 
written you 478 letters asking you this. We have your back. It's not 
what junk the Media says, it's how history sees you. Be historical - 
stop kxl.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Now that my wrist is healing and I 
can write again I have so many things to say to you. The articles on my 
table have been piling up! But first I want to thank YOU for your two 
identical letters of 11 July and 22 Dec 2014 stating that you will allow
 the Keystone XL pipeline to be built ONLY if it serves “our national 
interest.” You are under a lot of pressure from Republican bullies these
 days and I really appreciate your fortitude in the face of this 
political firestorm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/us/politics/with-veto-threat-obama-and-congress-head-for-collision-over-keystone-pipeline.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/us/politics/with-veto-threat-obama-and-congress-head-for-collision-over-keystone-pipeline.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Clearly the KXL provides NO general
 benefit to the US. A few Gulf Coast refineries will profit and then the
 oil will be sold abroad. This week congress is trying to force you to 
approve KXL with a bill. This is a cheap publicity stunt. They can’t 
take your executive authority away with a bill. It’s like children 
“voting” to make their parents let them have take-out pizza for dinner! 
Stay the course. Ignore their bombast! Do NOT help Canada get their 
filthy tar sands oil to Asian markets. I know the amount of oil is small
 on a world scale, but we really need to stop building new fossil fuel 
infrastructure. Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY! Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Susan J. Ringler, Appreciate your Fortitude</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">
Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In November Coral Davenport wrote a
 “Pipeline Pros and Cons” article in the NYTimes that so annoyed me that
 I wrote the attached letter to the Editor, which they did NOT publish. 
So here it is!</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: right;">19 Nov 2014</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Dear New York Times,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">In “Pipeline Pros and Cons” today, Ms. Davenport omitted one crucial fact about Keystone XL. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/us/politics/what-does-the-proposed-keystone-xl-pipeline-entail.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/us/politics/what-does-the-proposed-keystone-xl-pipeline-entail.html</a>? </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">NONE of the oil is for use in the US. We 
don’t need it. We have lots of our own cleaner oil. Canada wants the KXL
 solely to export oil to other continents, mostly Asia. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Think of it this way. I make mud pies, my
 neighbor makes mud pies. We both play with our own mud pies and get 
yelled at for the mess. My neighbor wants to track its dirty mud pies 
across my kitchen to sell them to someone else. I say NO WAY.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sell them out YOUR OWN back door.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don’t want your mess and that doesn’t make me a bad neighbor. There is no benefit to the US in approving KXL.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Susan Ringler</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Let me re-iterate: The US does not 
NEED any dirty tar sands oil. We are awash in cheaper cleaner Bakken 
oil. It is morally deplorable to support tar sands oil production. And 
now with oil dropping to $50 a barrel, tar sands oil is becoming far 
less profitable. The science is very very clear. We must cut our carbon 
emissions 4% <b>per year</b> or our grandchildren will live on a hellish planet. Thank you for <b>delaying</b>
 the Keystone XL Pipeline for years. Please Stop the KXL Right NOW! 
Congressional supporters of KXL are mis-guided by self-interest and 
greed. History will honor those who oppose KXL and who take serious 
steps to quickly reduce burning of fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">We are in the sway of severe 
weather disruptions all around the world. In November, Buffalo got 7 
feet of snow in 2 days and a few miles away there was none. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Refugees from Syria are huddling in
 Lebanon in a snowstorm, trying to shovel snow off roofs of tents. 
Instead of getting much needed RAIN, they get snow that brings little 
water and enormous misery. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Here in Boston the temperature was 
50 degrees F on 4 and 5 January, but didn’t get above 20 on 6 January! 
These rapid swings are the result of jet stream shifting that has become
 the new norm. Burning all this fossil fuel, putting all this carbon in 
the atmosphere is even affecting the WINDS. We will pay hugely for not 
paying attention to how quickly our climate is changing. If we act 
QUICKLY we can avoid the <b>worst</b>. Please Stop the Keystone XL 
Pipeline to show you understand how very SERIOUS a problem carbon 
pollution has caused. We must get off Fossil Fuels. Please lead us. Show
 your convictions. Future generations will thank you. I thank you too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was really dismayed to see this ad by the giant Norwegian oil Company Statoil in the NY Times on 5 December (page B5).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I feel sorry for the lively young woman Allison whose shining face they use to spread their very misleading message: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial;">“...To know where to search<span>&nbsp; </span>[for
 oil and gas], our passionate geoscientists develop advanced technology 
....Thanks to our passion, Statoil has become one of the most successful
 exploration companies in the world and we keep pushing to ensure 
continued success.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Far better would it be for Statoil 
to develop renewable energy and become an energy distribution company. 
The oil they “explore” for needs to stay in the ground. Please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline and show you understand that exploring for more oil
 is reckless because we cannot afford to burn the oil we have already 
discovered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Thank you.</span></p>

We have seen the world’s climate grow harsher in places in the last few 
decades. There are fewer resources to share (like WATER)! and in this 
misery it is all too easy for tribalism and extremism to flourish. We <u>humans</u> have caused these climate changes and now that we <b>know</b> that to be true, and realize the catastrophes we are in for, we must act <u>very quickly</u>
 to cut carbon emissions. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline right now
 as a first small step here in the US. It is so important to act now. It

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">A recent detailed study of earthquakes near Youngstown Ohio has concluded that <u>fracking</u> caused a build-up of subterranean pressure and a whole slew of <u>earthquakes</u>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/us/new-research-links-scores-of-earthquakes-to-fracking-wells-near-a-fault-in-ohio.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/us/new-research-links-scores-of-earthquakes-to-fracking-wells-near-a-fault-in-ohio.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">They are still pumping the oil out 
of the fracked cracks from last March, but the state has banned anymore 
fracking in that particular area. Well that is at least something! This 
is more evidence of how dangerous and untested high-pressure fracking 
IS!! The future costs to water supplies and public health are MUCH TOO 
GREAT. We do NOT need this oil and gas. We need to leave it in the 
ground and develop our renewable energy sources. Please Stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline right NOW. These sources of “cheap” oil are not 
CHEAP AT ALL. We are kidding ourselves and not considering the true 
costs to our climate and the health of the planet. No more knuckling 
under to happy talk from the fossil fuel industry. Stay stalwart, stay

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In November a Canadian journalist 
Andrew Nikiforuk wrote a moving piece about the vast destruction of 
millions of acres of boreal forest in Canada by Tar Sands mining 
companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/opinion/a-forest-threatened-by-keystone-xl.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/opinion/a-forest-threatened-by-keystone-xl.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Bitumen mining takes 3 barrels of 
water to produce one barrel of oil and the resulting polluted water is 
stored in more than a dozen HUGE waste pools along the Athabasca River. 
Pollutants are leaking into the river and the ground watre. To “restore”
 these devastated forest lands</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">“the 
miners plan to replace forest with artificial hills constructed of sand 
and pet coke. The hills will be topped with a salt-tolerant plantation 
forest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The mining industry calls this 
crude transformation “a sustainable landscape that is equal to or better
 than how we found it.” I doubt the animals would agree. The native 
indigenous<span>&nbsp; </span>peoples certainly don’t. Enough is enough.
 Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW. We don’t need this filthy oil
 and should not encourage the Canadians to pretend it is CHEAP. The 
environmental cost is too high. The carbon cost is too high. Tar sands 
mining is dangerous lunacy. Take a stand for your grandchildren. Stop

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I know it took a lot of grass roots
 effort with many many protests over many years to bring this about. 
Dozens of communities also passed moratoriums or fracking bans to show 
him the way – and it worked!! New York is a <u>big</u> <b>important</b> 
state. This is wonderful. It puts pressure on other states to follow his
 lead. It also shows YOU that missions of Americans don’t want fracking 
and they don’t want the KXL and other fossil fuel infrastructure. Please
 stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW! You can do it! We have your back. We

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was very pleased to read two

 him to testify and reveal a source of his for Chapter 9 of his book on 
Iran and the CIA. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Because Mr. Risen stood his ground 
and repeated that threat of sanctions would NOT make him reveal his 
sources, Mr. Holder instructed his underlings NOT to supoena Mr. Risen. 
The government backed down because it looks bad to send reporters to 
jail for doing their job – even if that job is revealing nasty 
government secrets about excessive force by the CIA and others in the 
name of the “war on terror.” Thank you for finally letting Mr. Risen get
 on with his life! Now can Mr. Snowden come home too? These men are 
heroes – shedding light on ugly government practices. I am embarrassed 
so much public money has been spent hounding these men. Make sure you 
spend an equal amount on RENEWABLE ENERGY! Please stop the Keystone XL

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was happy to read about California laying hens being allowed more room to spread their wings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/opinion/mark-bittman-hens-unbound.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/opinion/mark-bittman-hens-unbound.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It’s been a long time coming – the 
law was passed in 2008 and is finally in effect. It is especially great 
because about a third of the eggs sold in CA are raised out of state – 
and they must comply TOO. So once again, CA is on the forefront of a 
national trend. We can do this. Egg prices will go up a little but that 
is OK. They are pretty low now. Since we know that CA is a trend-setter,
 PLEASE take courage and <u>spread <b>your</b> wings</u> embracing not 
only less factory farming, but much stricter environmental laws. Please 
stop the Keystone XL Pipeline right now. Be a trend-setter. Spread your 
wings. If we don’t move quickly to stop carbon pollution right NOW, your
 grandchildren will be trapped in a much more hostile climate, with way 
fewer options than we have. It is SO important for you to act boldly on 
climate change. Please spread your wings. Do it NOW! Stop KXL. Thank 
you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I loved the article about Las 
Cruces, Mew Mexico where the city government approved a tent city for 
homeless people on empty city land. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/us/in-new-mexico-tent-city-a-glimmer-of-hope.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/us/in-new-mexico-tent-city-a-glimmer-of-hope.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">A range of social services set up outposts nearby and the homeless who first came for a meal, or medical help, began to <u>trust</u>
 the volunteers and social workers. This actually brought homeless 
people into housing that they would not otherwise have accepted. With a 
sense of vision, a city moved away from zoning laws that criminalized 
homelessness to ones that decriminalize and establish TRUST! This is how
 we build community and diminish tribalism! We are all on this planet 
together and must work together to combat climate disruption. You can be
 a <u>transformative force</u> on the path to a low carbon future. 
Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. That small change to 
business-as-usual can be a transformative moment for the fight to limit 
climate damage. A small transformative moment can have a far greater 
RIPPLE effect. Ban KXL now! Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was saddened in November to read that the Northern Shrimp harvest was cancelled for the second year in a row! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/us/waters-warm-in-gulf-of-maine-and-cod-catch-ebbs.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/us/waters-warm-in-gulf-of-maine-and-cod-catch-ebbs.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I wrote you last year about 
shutting down that fishing season in letter #249. Now there are so few 
shrimp they’ve cancelled again! We’ve been over-fishing in the Gulf of 
Maine for decades and now all we can do is wait and hope things will get
 better! Dream on! We have been too rapacious of the ocean’s bounty for 
decades if not longer. Fish baby fish! Drill baby drill! Is that all we 
know how to do? When will we wake up? In the search for boundless wealth
 we are quickly <u>hitting limits</u>. Our current practices are not 
SUSTAINABLE. We are heading for all sorts of climate and ecosystem 
disasters. So yes, let’s fish less, but also let’s put way less carbon 
into the air! The carbon is warming the planet, warming the oceans, 
causing far too rapid changes that play havoc with shrimp and ultimately
 US. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Stop it NOW! Shrimp may be 
small but climate change has HUGE consequences. We really need to change
 our ways. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I have fallen quite behind. I was 
distracted by a wonderful two weeks in France, but although I did not 
write much, I thought about you and about climate change. I was 
impressed with how much the French have invested, and continue to invest
 in <u>public transit</u>. All over Paris, 3 parking spaces have been replaced with 5 small electric cars with free plug-in charging.<span>&nbsp; </span>You
 can use them hourly for errands and they are frequently used! It’s a 
great additional transit mode that I would love to see here in Cambridge
 in addition to ZipCar. I was also impressed with bus and trolley 
signage in Paris and Bordeaux, telling you when the next bus is coming. 
Here only rich people with <u>smart phones</u> can get that info! Not 
very democratic. Signs help everyone and improve access. They encourage 
social justice and lessen the impact of income inequality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline <u>today</u>.
 Overheating the planet adds to social injustice – the longer we put off
 cutting back on fossil fuels, the more poor people will suffer. We 
really need to HURRY UP and get serious about reducing GH gases! Let’s 
speed up our investment in public transit instead. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Well I missed 3 snow storms while in France, but came back for another and more snow is forecast for tomorrow. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Boston has had over 7 feet of snow 
in just over 3 weeks and NONE has melted because it is so cold. New 
Hampshire, where people usually go to play in the snow, has had only 
half as much: only 3 to 4 feet. This is not just bad weather, this is 
climate DISRUPTION. We’ve gotten more snow in 3 to 4 weeks than Boston 
got in a whole season in 97 of the past 100 years! The jet stream has 
gotten bent far south and is stuck there and warmer ocean temperatures 
have produced more snow. I fear what sort of flooding we’ll get when 
this melts!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Can you not see the URGENCY? We 
have got to rapidly reduce our carbon emissions. If we stopped burning 
oil and gas today, our planet will continue to warm for 20 MORE YEARS. 
We can’t wait any longer. The time for decisive action is now! Please 
please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today. Right Now. The economic 
devastation from climate disruption will rapidly mount. Let’s get out in
 front of this problem instead of just following behind with a broom.

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It is so easy to fall behind in my

 very pleased to read that John Kiriakou was released from prison to 
house arrest. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">He was a CIA officer who wrote a 
book instrumental in exposing US torture and was prosecuted for leaking 
classified information. We need more ethical people like Mr. Kiriakou. I
 am ashamed at America’s use of torture and fervently hope it won’t 
happen again. As we enter a period of ever-faster climate change, more 
and more conflicts will occur in resource-stressed parts of the world. 
The best way to reduce these conflicts is to <u>leave fossil fuels</u> 
in the ground and quickly adopt renewable energy sources. Please Stop 
the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW as a first step towards quickly cutting 
carbon emissions. We cannot just carry on as if climate change is not a 
HUGE THREAT. The Pentagon itself recognizes that climate change will 
bring much political turmoil to the world. Let’s not make it worse. The 
faster we get off fossil fuels, the less extremism we will need to

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The causes are many: mismanagement,
 pollution, and a sever drought. Some are saying deforestation reduces 
the forest’s capacity to release humidity, thus exacerbating the 
drought. The Governor of Sao Paolo state says climate change has arrived
 to stay! Sao Paolo is a mega-city of 20 million – Brazil’s largest and 
wealthiest city – in a country known for abundant water! But how can the
 city stay wealthy withot water? The cost of climate change is huge – 
the price tag for lessening it relatively small. Please Stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY. Cheap oil and gas are NOT cheap. Paying an 
extra penny for renewable energy that does <u>not</u> worsen carbon 
pollution is money well-spent. We need to get past the rhetoric of 
conflicting industries and short-term corporate profits and really do 
what is right for our children and grandchildren. There has already been
 too much delay. How many more severe droughts and floods does it take 
until we act? Sao Paolo’s water problems are a lesson for us all. Thank

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Warren Buffett sold off all of his Exxon stock last quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/hedge-funds-offer-peek-at-their-holdings/">https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/hedge-funds-offer-peek-at-their-holdings/</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">That’s $4 Billion. It was part of a
 large energy sector sell-off - - so energy is now only 1.4% of his 
portfolio. Hmmmm. Buffett is a smart guy – this sounds a lot like <u>divesting</u>
 from fossil fuels – without calling it that! I am heartened by this and
 other developments in the divestment movement. In November a group of 
Harvard students sued the University for failing to divest, accusing 
Harvard of “mismanagement of charitable funds” and “ intentional 
investment in abnormally dangerous activities.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/521470f6b882777e188c56b603a7ce16.jpg" width="430" height="286"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Looks like Buffett judges fossil 
fuel stocks as too high-risk! Harvard’s President Faust claims that 
dropping fossil fuel stocks is neither “warranted or wise” but maybe 
it’s time to reconsider that. Call it divestment or dumping – as more 
investors exit the fossil fuel giants, their stocks will sink. Please 
nudge along the trend! Please Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline Right NOW! 
Send another signal that the heyday of fossil fuels is OVER. Dumping 
Exxon is <u>de facto</u> divestment and actions speak louder than words. Thank you.</span></p>

Bitter bitter cold here in Boston. 16 days straight below 32 degrees and
 much of that WELL below. 19 degrees in Atlanta GA, Denver has had 60s 
to 70s for much of this month, but it is now raining and will turn to

 of snow! The wind patterns across the globe are disrupted. Yes, any 
particular weather event does not prove climate change, but the

don’t want that dirty oil. It needs to stay in the ground. Don’t enable 
its use! Climate scientists tell us that the planet will continue to

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">They run their business with 
complete disregard for environmental laws and the health of Americans. 
It is only a shame that the federal charges are only a misdemeanor, and

for us to avoid the worst extremes of climate change. Please stop the 
Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY! Please show some backbone against Big Oil 
and all the fossil fuel producers. The situation is urgent and the 
business practices of Duke Energy demonstrate clearly that these are 
rogue industries intent on the greatest short-term profit at ANY COST!

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Remember my <a href="http://www.imaginevividly.com/Climate_Action_Letters.php#lett25">letter #25</a>
 to you about gas drilling under Loppersum Holland? That was March 2013,
 almost 2 years ago. Last week a new government study was published 
finding the Dutch government AND the oil companies <u>ignored</u> safety concerns, placing “financial and energy security concerns ahead of safety.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">A 2012 earthquake and a population 
of 150,000 in the gas field area forced the new study and government 
attention. In the US population is less dense near gas fields, so public
 outcry is more muted. But the fact is the only way to achieve financial
 and energy security is to leave fossil fuels IN THE GROUND! Please Stop
 the Keystone XL Pipeline today. Learn a lesson from LOPPERSUM. Fossil 
fuels are dangerous to residents near wells and to every one of us on 
the planet. Our climate is disrupted and will only get much worse. We 
need to wake up now. We need to quickly ramp up production of renewable

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Pakistan is falling apart, even 
more than usual. A sobering article 2 weeks ago reports on a devastating
 water crisis which the Water Minister refuses to call a DROUGHT, 
preferring to speak of “water stress.”<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/world/asia/pakistan-braces-for-major-water-shortages.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/world/asia/pakistan-braces-for-major-water-shortages.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Particularly telling is the ERRATIC pattern of rainfall. “The frequency of monsoon rains has <u>decreased</u>, but their intensity has <u>increased</u>.”
 Severe climate DISRUPTION is destabilizing an already fragile country. 
Pakistan is a poorly-run home for almost 200 million people and no 
stranger to extremist groups. Agriculture is a mainstay of the economy, 
but as cities have swelled, the poor are less and less able to feed 
themselves. Electricity is at best intermittent. Chaos is just waiting 
to erupt. You can’t fix many of Pakistan’s ills, but you CAN take an 
emphatic stance against <u>climate change</u>. Please stop the Keystone 
XL Pipeline TODAY! We need to stop using fossil fuels URGENTLY and 
RAPIDLY. There are too many warning signs to ignore. Please stop this 
madness. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I send you this beautiful floral

peacefully demonstrating against proposed shale gas fracking in their 
country. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This is truly a grass-roots 
movement built on common sense. Why does Total want to use methods in 
Algeria that they are banned from using in Europe? Why frack in a desert
 where there is almost no water (fracking uses huge amounts of water)? 
Why do simple people understand the dangers of climate change better 
than most elected officials and their minions?<span>&nbsp; </span>Please
 stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is the only MORAL option. We have 
pumped far too much carbon into the atmosphere. We must leave the 
remaining fossil fuel IN THE GROUND. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In your 26 Feb 2015 letter* regarding the FCC decision to protect net neutrality, you affirm:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">“I ran 
for office because I believed that nothing can stand in the way of 
millions of voices calling for change. That’s the backbone of our 
democracy – and you’ve proven that this timeless principle is alive and 
well in our digital age.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">There are millions of voices calling for change in our energy supplies, telling you that <b>climate change</b>
 is the biggest world challenge of the century, far bigger than net 
neutrality. So PLEASE let nothing stand in the way of these voices! 
Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline right now! Please add your powerful
 voice calling urgently to stop carbon pollution. We cannot afford any 
more delay. We must keep fossil fuels in the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Yesterday I signed a Greenpeace-sponsered online petition against arctic drilling for offshore oil. I added this comment:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">“Please withdraw your support for offshore Arctic drilling. There is new evidence that it simply cannot be done safely.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Royal 
Dutch Shell recently announced its formal intention to drill for oil in 
the remote Chukchi Sea in the Alaskan Arctic in 2015, depending on OUR 
government's response. That is YOU.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>&nbsp;</span>In
 the past you have supported drilling for oil in the region, but the 
mounting CLIMATE CRISIS makes the case against arctic drilling 
UNDENIABLE.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">We 
don't need the oil. It's too expensive. The environmental cost is too 
high. And most importantly, Arctic oil MUST STAY IN THE GROUND if we are
 to keep temperatures from rising to dangerous levels.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please deny Shell the necessary permits and permissions it needs to drill in 2015.“ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Please also stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. These issues are intimately related and <u>urgent</u>. We <b>must</b> develop renewable energy and quickly ratchet-down our use of fossil fuels.</span></p>

</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Yesterday I went to a rally in 
downtown Boston to Save Cape Wind – a wind farm proposed 14 years ago 
off Cape Cod that would be the FIRST US <u>off-shore</u> wind farm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/us/plan-for-offshore-wind-farm-in-nantucket-sound-hits-a-snag.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/us/plan-for-offshore-wind-farm-in-nantucket-sound-hits-a-snag.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Europe</span><span style="font-family: arial;">
 has dozens of off-shore wind farms and more under construction. We 
desperately need off-shore wind farms. Bill Koch has mounted 26 lawsuits
 against Cape Wind – all of which <u>have failed</u> – because he 
doesn’t want to look at wind turbines way out on the horizon and he has 
billions (petro-money) to throw at his annoyance (see my letter #209). 
He has delayed the project so long it is foundering. This makes me 
ANGRY. Government is not standing <u>in the way</u> of Cape Wind. The 
site was chosen by government agencies as the best suited, and all sorts
 of permits have been granted. But the government isn’t helping 
sufficiently either! This project provides electricity where there is <u>not enough</u>. It will provide good long-term jobs to New Bedford that NEEDS them. It starts off-shore wind energy as an industry. It is <u>renewable</u>
 energy. Our democracy is badly broken when one man can stop all this! 
So please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline and show that you and your 
government are committed to fighting carbon pollution. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was really struck recently by an 
article reporting that Hispanics are more likely than non-Hispanic 
whites to be personally concerned about global warming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/us/politics/climate-change-is-of-growing-personal-concern-to-us-hispanics-poll-finds.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/us/politics/climate-change-is-of-growing-personal-concern-to-us-hispanics-poll-finds.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Hey! Smart people! Many have 
relatives outside the US and so have a more global perspective. They see
 that poor people everywhere are hit hardest by pollution and climate 
disruption. They also work outside a lot and have closer ties to farming
 and gardening. They notice climate disruption more and think more about
 small subsistence farmers all over the world. I really hope they VOTE 
in record numbers in 2016. Because a big increase in Hispanic voting 
will certainly benefit Democrats more than Republicans. If all the poor 
and disenfranchised and young would vote in this country, our democracy 
would work a lot better. So Please STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline! Do it 
for Hispanic voters. Do it so more Hispanics VOTE! Do it for poor people
 everywhere. Do it for people of color everywhere. You know who gets 
hurt first. Thank you.</span></p>

<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">There
 have been a lot of articles about the TPP trade pact recently, but the 
one that gives me the most hope is the report that Tea Party members 
have joined with Democrats to oppose “fast track” permission. </span></p>

<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">NAFTA
 and other recent large trade pacts do NOT help ordinary workers either 
here OR abroad, but instead make large businesses more profitable. Tea 
Party members oppose “fast-track” because it gives too much power to the
 President, you, and for once I agree with them. They have a 
philosophical problem with giving the President too much power. I just 
think <u>this</u> trade pact is morally reprehensible! I’ve written 
before against TPP (letters #240, and #268) and repeat that it gives 
corporations way too much power, allowing them, for example, to sue to 
weaken <b>environmental laws</b>. Why don’t you use your considerable 
power to further the cause of climate justice? All workers on the planet
 need a hospitable climate to thrive!<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-family: arial;">Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY! and then make <u>huge rapid strides</u> towards reducing carbon pollution.<span style="color: #222222;"> Thank you.</span></span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">My son asked me the other day why you were pushing the TPP trade pact when so many Democrats in Congress oppose it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/business/democrats-step-up-efforts-to-block-obama-on-trade-promotion-authority.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/business/democrats-step-up-efforts-to-block-obama-on-trade-promotion-authority.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I told him that it really is about 
trying to lessen China’s growing power in the Pacific Rim. US, Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand, Brunei: these are all countries that think they 
can get better prices from TPP countries than from China. This is really
 about super-powers jockeying for position. It is NOT about improving 
labor standards for workers. And the cost to workers and the environment
 is TOO HIGH. Fear mongers are telling you that you must rein in China, 
and TPP is the means to that end. But the much larger threat facing us 
all is <b>climate change</b>! That’s where your energy should go. Please
 stop the Keystone XL Pipeline as the first small step to quitting 
fossil fuels. Nothing else on your agenda is anywhere near as <b>urgent</b> as the climate. Don’t be distracted by the clamoring of big business for more trade rules to make them richer. <span style="color: #222222;">Thank you.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I am glad you are marching in Selma
 AL today. It renews hope that we can continue to make progress on 
social justice for ALL. But I also want to advocate for trade unions and
 remind you that the systematic gutting of trade unions in America has 
widened income inequality hugely. Eduardo Porter reminds us that the US 
has “some of the weakest labor protections IN THE ADVANCED WORLD” for 
which I am ashamed, as you should be too. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">All those civil rights marches in 
the 1960’s were collaborations of social and UNION leaders. Nicholas 
Kristof tells us that at least 20% and perhaps 33% of the increase in 
economic inequality in the US among men is the result of the decline of 
UNIONS. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">And if you really want social justice, you must fight for <b>climate justice</b>, for income inequality and worse will SOAR as climate disruption spreads across the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please
 stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today. Do not let Big Oil business put 
profits ahead of people. Let’s strengthen our labor unions and march 
together towards a better world with less carbon pollution and more

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I write today in support of Timothy
 Searchinger and 78 other scientists who recently wrote to the EPA 
director against the recent EPA policy memo encouraging cutting trees to
 produce power as “carbon-neutral.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/d12470f3a69165687d0d7740a099a0d4.jpg" width="144" height="144"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course the scientists are 
correct! Planting huge amounts of biomass to use to create electricity 
is not carbon free! The “surplus forest growth” is already storing 
carbon. Shame on the EPA for caving to the corn/ethanol wing of 
agribusiness and their spin doctors telling us how “green” ethanol is. 
Why is ethanol production outstripping wind energy? Duh! Because <u>no one owns the wind</u>
 and farmers grow and own corn. So once again the profit motive skews 
the scientific discussion and the EPA allows themselves to accept BAD 
SCIENCE. This is not some idle philosophical debate. The future of our 
planet is at stake – or at least the human dominance of the planet. 
Science tells us we MUST abandon fossil fuels.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please
 stop the Keystone XL Pipeline to point the way towards renewable 
carbon-free energy. Do not let science be co-opted by the bio-fuel 
juggernaut. Time’s a wasting. <span style="color: #222222;">Thank you.</span></span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Syngenta is a Swiss chemical 
company that makes atrazine – the most popular pesticide in the US – 
used on most sorghum, corn, and sugar cane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrazine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrazine</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Atrazine has been banned in Europe for more than 10 years! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/business/international/a-pesticide-banned-or-not-underscores-trans-atlantic-trade-sensitivities.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/business/international/a-pesticide-banned-or-not-underscores-trans-atlantic-trade-sensitivities.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Well, “banned as a pesticide” not 
“banned” outright! This is semantics the Swiss company tries to hide 
behind. The basic problem is that in Europe, companies have to prove a 
new chemical is SAFE before it can be used. In the US, regulators have 
to prove it is UNSAFE to stop it being used! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">So which approach would you use for your own family? Probably the cautious European one! Why does <b>profit</b>
 trump health and safety in the US? And why does oil company profit 
trump the known disastrous global hazards of CARBON POLLUTION? Please 
stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY. Do not let short-term profit 
outrank all other concerns. Syngenta keeps Swiss children safe and 
profits from <u>our</u> lax laws, but carbon pollution affects the <u>whole planet</u>.
 If we wait to limit carbon emissions until we PROVE they are very 
dangerous, it will be too late to stop the juggernaut of climate change!

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I
 am delighted to read the Robert Bryce op-ed piece on Ethanol and the 
hidden taxes we pay because the Renewable Fuel Standard (created in 
2005) mandates blending ethanol into our gasoline. </span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/opinion/end-the-ethanol-rip-off.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/opinion/end-the-ethanol-rip-off.html</a></span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The
 goals in 2005 were: energy security (import less oil), rural economic 
development (pay farmers to plant corn), and some supposed environmental
 protections. This10 year experiment needs to be ENDED because: 1. 
Bakken crude means we import less oil, 2. corn subsidies are outdated 
and only help big-ag, and 3. growing the extra corn and processing it 
into ethanol has caused significant environmental COSTS with no benefit.
 The ethanol tax is <b>bad</b> policy and needs to stop. Let’s get rid 
of ethanol, raise the gas tax an equivalent amount, and pour that $10 
Billion per year into <b>renewable</b> energy: WIND and SOLAR!! We need REAL environmental solutions to <b>carbon pollution</b>, not fake <b>ethanol</b>
 boondoggles. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline Right Now. Show you 
are serious about quickly reducing our carbon footprint. We don’t have 
time to waste on bad policy. Serious carbon reduction goals are what we 
need, not more <b>ethanol</b> production. <span style="color: #222222;">Thank you.</span></span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">On Monday I saw a preview of the new documentary film “Merchants of Doubt,” <a href="http://sonyclassics.com/merchantsofdoubt/">http://sonyclassics.com/merchantsofdoubt/</a></span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">an
 excellent exposé of lobbying efforts to cast doubt on the science of 
climate change. Strong parallels are made with the 50 year tobacco 
industry campaign to delay regulation of cigarettes. Many of the 
lobbyists are even the same! The <b>terrifying</b> difference is that carbon pollution affects <b>everyone</b>
 on the planet and we don’t have 50 years to stall before regulating 
CARBON!! I hope millions of people see this movie and clamor for rapid 
curbs on carbon emissions! Please use the full power of your authority 
to <b>quickly</b> reduce carbon pollution. </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Please
 stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY to show how important a problem 
carbon pollution IS! And make sure you see the movie! It’s really fun 
too! The card-trick magician is incredible to watch – just wish he had 
as much money as the climate-change denial guys.<span style="color: #222222;"> Thank you.</span></span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">A recent headline proclaimed “Europe Unlikely to Meet Climate Goal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/world/europe-unlikely-to-meet-climate-goal-study-finds.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/world/europe-unlikely-to-meet-climate-goal-study-finds.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">What a downer! or was it supposed to make US feel good and excuse our feeble climate goals? The article reports that Europe is <b>ON TRACK</b> to meet its goal of reducing GHG 20% below 1990 levels <b>by 2020</b>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It’s their far more aggressive <b>2050</b>
 goal they are having trouble with (reducing emissions 80% by 2050). 
HOORAY for Europe! Their goal for 2020 was WAY greater than ours and 
they are meeting it! WE ARE NOT!! The only thing China and the US have 
agreed to is for China to stop <b>raising</b> emissions by 2030, and for the US to cut emissions a little faster (but nowhere near as fast as Europe)!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Look, in 1990, United States CO2 emissions were just over 5000 million metric tons. In 2005 they were over 6000 million tons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>&nbsp;</span><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/4cb6e339590e16b40f114e00d332b349_8w5y.png" width="574" height="443"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">For the USA to equal Europe’s reduction of 20% <b>below</b> their 1990 levels, we would have to get to 4000 million tons !!! <b>We can’t even get back to 5000 million tons</b>. US carbon emissions ROSE 2 % in 2013!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/13/after-years-of-decline-u-s-carbon-emissions-rose-2-percent-in-2013/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/13/after-years-of-decline-u-s-carbon-emissions-rose-2-percent-in-2013/</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It’s snowing again – about an inch 
or 2. People say that this will break the previous “snowiest year” 
record for Boston. But at the risk of repeating myself, the significance
 here is that over 90% of that snow fell in <b>about 3 weeks</b>. That’s more snow in 3 weeks than in most whole winters. Statisticians say there is a <b>1 in 26,000</b> chance of that happening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This is way more rare than a 
hundred-year event!!&nbsp;So pay attention! We are flooding the 
atmosphere with carbon pollution. We are doing very little about it, 
thus condemning future generations to clean up the mess – <b>if they even CAN</b>!
 Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline – today – Right NOW! Let’s turn 
this train around and start rapidly reducing GHG emissions. Don’t worry 
about the politics, or the people who say you’re wrong, or stupid, or 
weak, or whatever. You just need to spend your remaining time as 
President doing what <b>YOU think is important!</b> So start fighting for the planet and future generations. It’s important. Thank you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I’ve been writing you letters for over 2 years now and so want to share some <b>good</b>
 news today! Andrew Sorkin recently wrote that PNC Financial will no

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Hooray! This is a 
big change for PNC and great news for mountains in coal states. GE 
Capital and UBS now remain the only large financial lenders in the US 
willing to lend to these coal companies. Cutting off financing is a 
great weapon. It makes this type of mining more expensive. We need to 
stop all coal mining and we certainly need to start by banning 
mountain-top removal! I’m so glad PNC is quitting because of their “risk
 appetite” – that means investing in coal could make them lose money! 
Hooray hooray! Now please, to celebrate, please STOP the Keystone XL 
Pipeline. No more fossil fuel infrastructure – not pipelines and not 
mountain-top removal.</span></p>

<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">This is exactly what we need. They can manage an electricity distribution system that is <b>much more</b>
 efficient than our existing ones. People keep saying that solar isn’t 
cost effective, but by taking control of the distribution system, 
SolarCity can make money on ALL aspects of power and delivery. Hey, if 
military bases want this technology, it must be able to DELIVER!</span></p>

 owns the sun, but we do own the grid and it’s about time we started 
making micro-grids particularly suited to RENEWABLE energy. So Please 
STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is old dirty energy. Get off fossil 
fuels. That’s what we need to do! Solar is the energy of the future, so 
let’s develop appropriate ways of distributing that energy. No to 
pipelines. Yes to Microgrids. Thank you.</span></p>

 That’s a great idea and electric mail trucks would help! I posted the 
19 March article to my petition saying “Great Minds Think Alike!” Lots

<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">By postponing this <b>bad</b> pipeline this long you have <b>slowed</b>

just be done with it and cancel this pipeline! Another small step 
towards a resilient climate for the planet. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The Supreme Court 
is hearing arguments this week on whether it is “appropriate and 
necessary” to regulate mercury emissions from power plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/opinion/clean-air-act-and-dirty-coal-at-the-supreme-court.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/opinion/clean-air-act-and-dirty-coal-at-the-supreme-court.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">This is the 3<sup>rd</sup>
 set of cases against the EPA in 2 years. The lawyers have been using 
words like “capacious” and “capricious”, elegant complex language that 
comes from Latin. But the arguments are really about money and the coal 
industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/us/division-seen-in-supreme-court-on-pollution-limits.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/us/division-seen-in-supreme-court-on-pollution-limits.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Curbing mercury is 
expensive, so it’s cheaper for power plants to switch to gas than add 
mercury scrubbers. A few shortened lives of poor people who live near 
coal-fired power plants is OK. Because if we stop burning coal for 
electricity, coal loses most of its domestic business, and can’t survive
 on exports alone. Mercury accumulates in our bodies forever. It doesn’t
 wash away. Too much and you die. That’s why rich countries don’t burn 
coal in homes and cities. <b>It’s bad for us</b>. So why is it OK for power plants in poor neighborhoods to burn coal? Because they matter less? That’s unacceptable. <b>If coal is too dirty for the White House fireplace, it’s too dirty for power plants. </b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Of course it’s 
appropriate for the EPA to regulate mercury. If the Supreme Court 
decides otherwise, they are corrupt. And while we are waiting for this 
decision, please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Do it NOW! We need to 
quickly get off fossil fuels – but coal first! Thank you.</span></p>

<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Letter # 527</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Yesterday US 
senators voted on over 700 non-binding amendments to a non-binding 
budget bill. Insiders call it a vote-orama, a way to put yourself and 
others on record for all sorts of issues – large and small. I commend </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Senator Bernard<span>&nbsp; </span>Sanders. Independent from Vermont, for his amendment on the LARGEST issue of our times:<span style="color: #222222;"> CLIMATE CHANGE. Senator Sanders’ amendment, stating that “climate change is caused by human activity” failed 50 to 49! </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/03/26/us/politics/26reuters-usa-budget-votearama.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/03/26/us/politics/26reuters-usa-budget-votearama.html?_r=0</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">And at least 1 of the 49 votes in favor, is a vote <u>against</u>
 any action on climate change! Senator Portman of Ohio, who is a vocal 
opponent of curbing emissions (as too costly, and not necessary) voted 
FOR the Sanders amendment because it didn’t say “<b>significant</b> human activity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.bucyrustelegraphforum.com/story/news/local/2015/03/26/portman-climate-change-vote-hinges-one-word/70504804/">http://www.bucyrustelegraphforum.com/story/news/local/2015/03/26/portman-climate-change-vote-hinges-one-word/70504804/</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">So let it go on record that <b>51 senators</b>
 are Blocking Action on Decreasing Carbon Emissions and Efforts to 
Reduce Climate Change. May their descendents curse them! I am mortified 
to be an American when I see so many leaders putting short term status 
and greed ahead of the health of our planet. Please STOP the Keystone XL
 Pipeline NOW! End this lunacy of denial. Let’s get busy replacing 
fossil fuels with Renewables right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Thank you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Susan J. Ringler, Commend Bernard Sanders</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">P.S. The current Congress (114<sup>th</sup>) has </span><span style="font-family: arial;">54 Republicans, 44 Democrats, and 2 Independents (pro-Dem). Sanders got 5 Republican votes, Portman and <span style="color: #222222;">4 others. So a few Republicans acknowledge climate change and at least 1 Democrat does not.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Our advanced civilizations have the
 power and resources to capture such detailed data and images, yet we

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I’ve been collecting factoids pointing to climate disruption. Here are a few:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Cod Vanishing as Gulf of Maine Warms. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/us/frozen-fishing-from-a-new-england-port.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/us/frozen-fishing-from-a-new-england-port.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The Gulf of Maine used to warm about 1 degree every 20 years, now it’s 1 degree every 2 years. So less cod and more lobster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Snow Down, Heat Up in Arctic. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/science/snow-is-down-and-heat-is-up-in-the-arctic-report-says.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/science/snow-is-down-and-heat-is-up-in-the-arctic-report-says.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It may have been cold in New 
England but the arctic snow cover in the Eurasian arctic is dwindling. 
New Bedford port iced in this winter, fishing boats idled. These are all
 disruptions to the normal patterns and we will see more and more 
frequent DISRUPTIONS. Taken together the warnings are ominous! We must 
act quickly to limit climate change. Please STOP the Keystone XL 
Pipeline NOW. We need more renewable energy and less fossil fuel RIGHT 
AWAY. Thank you.</span></p>

 end is in sight. The instability, tribalism, and violence is fed by 
several factors, but one important one is <u>dwindling water</u> and 
other resources DUE to CLIMATE CHANGE. This instability endangers the 
whole world, not jut that region. If we have any sense we will quickly 
take major steps to reduce our carbon emissions. Foreign policy is 
tricky and fluid. But climate change is CERTAIN. Please STOP the 
Keystone XL Pipeline today and take rapid actions to reduce emissions. <span>&nbsp;</span>Some
 things we can alter, others we cannot. Please do what you can NOW to 
limit climate change. It will also help lessen the causes of regional 
conflicts. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I would like to thank you for your 
31 March letters to 22 prisoners commuting their sentences for 
non-violent drug crimes and ordering their release in July. I am happy 
you reminded them that they “have the capacity to make good choices.” 
And I ask you to reflect on your own <u>enormous</u> capacity as President of a very powerful nation to <u>make choices</u> that have world-wide impact. When you leave office will you look back and decide you made the <u>best possible</u>
 choices? I sincerely hope so. I encourage you to commute many more 
non-violent sentences and return thousands of people to productive 
lives. And I urge you to squarely face the climate crisis in its full 
enormity and to take many decisive actions to lessen the harm. The first
 step is to STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline. Please take up your pen and 
do it NOW. For if you can’t take this small step, what are people to 
think? We voted for you, we gave you special presidential powers. <span>&nbsp;</span>You need to use that power for GOOD, for the best possible world outcome that you can. Thank you.</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I write today of 
trucks and trains. The trucking industry is trying to get language into a
 highway funding bill that will allow longer and heavier trucks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/politics/trucking-and-rail-industries-turn-state-troopers-into-unwitting-lobbyists.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/politics/trucking-and-rail-industries-turn-state-troopers-into-unwitting-lobbyists.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The railroad industry is trying to 
keep the status quo. Each side is using deception, lots of money, and 
unwitting sheriffs and state troopers. But the non-profit Citizens for 
Reliable and Safe Highways receives NO money from either side and 
remains convinced that longer heavier trucks would be LESS SAFE. Neither
 side mentions that goods transported by rail have a <u>smaller carbon footprint</u>. Trains are clearly the better choice – in so many ways. And yes I know there have been 3 bad oil train accidents recently.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><img alt="" src="LettersToObama_files/46a8aad99efcdc2faedd7ab17f92b4fe.jpg" width="495" height="298"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">But the answer there is shorter 
trains, not trucks or pipelines. Let’s hope common sense prevails here 
and current truck size limits REMAIN. Meanwhile, since we know the 
future MUST hold fewer trucks and fewer pipelines, Please STOP the 
Keystone XL Pipeline today. And those trains that carry oil today can be
 carrying other goods when the pipelines are empty and no longer used. 
Thank you.</span></p>

Clarke says “Glaciers don’t respond to weather; they respond to 
climate.” It is still possible that strong immediate measures to 
decrease carbon emissions can slow or <u>level off</u> this melting! 
Let’s get going Right Away! Please STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY. 
We need glaciers for water, for cooling, for stable weather. I remember 
walking on a glacier at Glacier National Park in July 1960, and I 
crossed an amazing glacier on a trek near Karimabad, Pakistan (Gilgit 
region) in 1990.<span>&nbsp; </span>That Pakistan area is VERY DRY and 
villages depend on glacial runoff for almost all their water. This is 
URGENT in so many ways. Thank you.</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">There have been lots of articles about the California drought recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/california-imposes-first-ever-water-restrictions-to-deal-with-drought.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/california-imposes-first-ever-water-restrictions-to-deal-with-drought.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Some, focusing on new limits for towns and cities, obscured the real problem: un restricted agricultural use of groundwater. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/opinion/making-sense-of-water.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/opinion/making-sense-of-water.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">As Mark Bittman correctly states, 
the real issue is how to “allocate water sensibly.” 80% of California 
water is used by agriculture and most of that is “free” for the 
landowner who can dig a deep enough well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/science/beneath-california-crops-groundwater-crisis-grows.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/science/beneath-california-crops-groundwater-crisis-grows.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Big Ag now drills mega-wells 
pulling groundwater from a huge area. Like other extractive businesses, 
the public resource is monetized for the profit of a few. Aquifers are 
depleted for Big Ag profits. Small farms don’t have the money to dig 
deep enough wells. As with carbon pollution, the long term costs to the 
environment and society of aquifer depletion are <u>ignored</u>. We need a <u>national</u> price on carbon and a <u>national</u>
 water price to curb aquifer depletion. Big business will slow both 
efforts, so in the meantime, please STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline, RIGHT
 NOW. Your job as President is to do things that are good for <u>everyone</u>,<span>&nbsp; </span>not
 just the richest businesses, or the loudest lobbyists. We need to get 
off fossil fuels QUICKLY, and a first step is stopping KXL. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was busy last week participating 
at Harvard Heat Week to ask Harvard to divest from Big Oil investments. I
 was quoted in this Crimson article where I called Harvard “a beacon. 
When Harvard does something, people notice!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I made 200 Heat Week buttons to 
honor people for their actions, especially the students sleeping outside
 Massachusetts Hall night after night. I was happy to see Bill McKibben 
wearing one of my buttons when he was interviewed on TV on Greater 
Boston. It would be grand <u>if you too</u> would ask Harvard to divest 
from Big Oil, as one of their most prominent alumni. But until then we 
are happy to have raised awareness of climate change around Cambridge 
and to have forged stronger ties to allies from historic divestment 
campaigns and allies in the social justice community. Raising the 
minimum wage and divesting from Big Oil are <u>connected</u> endeavors. 
So I ask you to please STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline because of climate 
injustice and social injustice and as a small step towards a more just 
future for all people. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Happy Earth Day. You are touring 
the Everglades today and none of the trees look like this, but some of 
the canals do: orderly straight cuts through the earth. We got to 
thinking that we could engineer the dirt and water and the plants and 
animals would thrive in their orderly rearranged world. These Ravenna 
artists a thousand years ago didn’t think like that! They saw nature as a
 huge scary force and calm images like this could offer respite from the
 chaos of life. Now people probably look at this and wonder why the 
“pixels” aren’t square!! It’s sad that we needed to invent Earth Day 45 
years ago. And the earth hasn’t gotten much healthier. Please STOP the 
Keystone XL Pipeline RIGHT NOW. Do it for the earth and all who live 
here for the next 1000 years! Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was pleased to read yesterday 
that Oklahoma’s Republican government has acknowledged the scientific 
consensus that wastewater wells from oil and gas drilling is causing <u>hundreds</u> of earthquakes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/us/oklahoma-acknowledges-wastewater-from-oil-and-gas-wells-as-major-cause-of-quakes.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/us/oklahoma-acknowledges-wastewater-from-oil-and-gas-wells-as-major-cause-of-quakes.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This is an excellent step in the right direction in a part of the country known for <u>inaction</u> on climate change. Of course it is a <u>small</u> step, as they need to <u>stop</u> drilling more wells and <u>lessen</u> the danger of existing wells. Loppersum, Netherlands came to the same conclusions <u>years</u>
 ago! (See my letters #405 and #504). But every day of delay and 
inaction is another day of profit for oil and gas companies. So their <u>inaction</u> requires our <u>action</u>.
 Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW. You know dangerous the 
climate crisis is. You spoke of it yesterday, Earth Day, in the 
Everglades. Now you must match your ACTIONS to your words. Let’s get off
 fossil fuels. STOP more pipelines. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">To call them “mis-informed, isolationist, and politically motivated” is mean and untrue. TPP <u>is</u>
 bad for US workers and bad for the environment. Your support for TPP is
 based on an outdated view of world power: US hegemony in Asia is better
 than Chinese hegemony! Some of us think that fewer treaties and 
less-consolidated power for multi-national corporations is way more 
likely to speed up the urgent battle against climate change. While the 
US and China jockey for power, carbon pollution continues to mount, and 
social injustice keeps pace! I am saddened that the Pentagon 
fear-mongers have clouded your vision! So please reassure me that you 
are serious about climate change and STOP the Keystone XL pipeline.

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Some say you legally had no choice 
but to allow Shell oil the permit to drill in arctic waters because they
 paid $2Billion in 2008 for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/us/white-house-gives-conditional-approval-for-shell-to-drill-in-arctic.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/us/white-house-gives-conditional-approval-for-shell-to-drill-in-arctic.html</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The better choice would have been 
to let them sue, drag it out until cheaper oil elsewhere makes the 
arctic too expensive, and buy the lease back for less than they paid. 
They took the risk, the world has changed a lot since 2008, they lose. 
It is unconscionable to write to me a few weeks ago “climate change is 
real and we have to act now … I refuse to condemn our children to a 
planet that is beyond fixing …” But that is <u>what you are doing</u>! Your climate action plan is a <u>tiny</u> step forward. Granting Shell this lease to drill in arctic waters is a <u>big</u>
 step backward. I am very disappointed in your actions to combat climate
 change. Please STOP the Keystone XL pipeline today and show yourself as
 a true leader on combating climate change. Thank you.</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">A recent op-ed 
column argues that we shouldn’t waste taxpayers money on revamping 
LaGuardia Airport, but should build housing there instead. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The civil engineer 
and transportation planner makes NO mention of climate change or rising 
sea levels. Many transportation planners unfortunately suffer the same 
myopia! Thank you to the NYTimes for printing Ted Steinberg’s letter (1 
of 5 they printed) who aptly responds that LaGuardia’s site is 
hurricane-prone, low-lying and unsuitable for both airports and housing.
 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/opinion/la-guardia-airport-fix-it-or-shut-it.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/opinion/la-guardia-airport-fix-it-or-shut-it.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">But I am deeply 
saddened that climate change is NOT mentioned. Our national discourse 
does not mention climate change and the urgency of our response nearly 
enough! Most of our coastal airports are at risk. We are in denial as to
 how much time we have to turn this calamity around. </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Please
 STOP the Keystone XL pipeline NOW to make sure everyone knows what your
 stance on climate change is. We cannot continue to chat about costs and
 benefits without addressing the enormous human cost of climate 
disruption. </span></p>

difficult summer, loss, anger, sadness … but I am finding my balance 
again and so want to continue writing to you. I was gladdened by Yoko 
Ono’s full page ad last week against fracking and specifically the 
“Constitution Pipeline,” a name she so aptly calls <u>Orwellian</u>. I love her appeal to you as a father of <u>two beautiful daughters</u> and urge you to act boldly to protect <u>their futures</u>.
 We are swimming in gas and don’t need to build pipelines for export. 
The danger to our homes and the entire planet is TOO GREAT! Yoko urges 
you to imagine a better world for ALL OF US! A world without fracking 
and without the Keystone XL pipeline. A world where we have not totally 
ruined the climate with CARBON POLLUTION, where your daughters can 
thrive. So please please listen to Yoko and </span><span style="font-family: arial;">please STOP the Keystone XL pipeline <u>today</u>. Just pick up your pen! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Thank you for visiting a federal prison and for saying “There but for fortune ...” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Our incarceration rate for 
non-violent crimes is way too high and for the President to advocate 
openly for prison reform gives hope to many. We need to give young 
people more good choices in their neighborhoods so they don’t land in 
prison. In these very difficult times of climate disruption we need 
everyone to pull together. What about federal grants for jobs to replace
 old windows and otherwise make buildings energy efficient? I know such 
an idea needs backing from Congress, and is unlikely to happen soon. So 
instead, please STOP the Keystone XL pipeline right now! You don’t need 
Congress to do this. Just pick up your pen! Please do it now and send a 
powerful message to all Americans, young and old, free and incarcerated,
 that we need to quickly cut our carbon emissions. Bold action NOW will 
save us billions. Thank you.</span></p>

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">On Monday the Norwegian Refugee 
Council published a report detailing the 2014 numbers of people 
displaced by natural disasters: 19.3 MILLION mostly from weather-related
 (typhoons and flooding) events that are becoming more FREQUENT and more
 INTENSE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/asia/disasters-both-natural-and-weather-related-displaced-19-million-in-2014.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/asia/disasters-both-natural-and-weather-related-displaced-19-million-in-2014.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">These numbers should <u>galvanize</u>
 us into action! We should be redoubling our efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But instead America seems to shrug 
off any responsibility for a worsening climate, confident that if the 
sun shines tomorrow all will be well. As our leader you need to <u>show the way</u>. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today and make a firm statement that fossil fuels must <b>stay in the ground</b>
 – for the safety of us all and our children. You understand the climate
 science – so please take urgent and definitive action. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The best climate news this year may well be Pope Francis’ encyclical on climate change last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/world/europe/pope-francis-in-sweeping-encyclical-calls-for-swift-action-on-climate-change.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/world/europe/pope-francis-in-sweeping-encyclical-calls-for-swift-action-on-climate-change.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">He not only describes our carbon emissions as posing an <u>urgent threat</u> to the stability of the world’s climate, he also speaks to our <u>moral</u> responsibility to the world’s poor, who will bear the most pain and damage from a problem they did <u>nothing</u>
 to create. It is heartening to hear one of the planet’s most prominent 
leaders speak so clearly to denounce greed and social injustice. So 
please follow the Pope’s lead and take immediate dramatic steps to cut 
carbon emissions. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline NOW. It will show
 you too are a great leader. We are counting on you. Thank you.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">A
 few days ago a really terrible program aired on PBS called “Humanity 
from Space.” I would love to know who paid for it and who wrote it. It 
is a glossy manipulative piece sending the happy message that the 
largest corporations will help us innovate out of <u>all</u> problems. I wrote to WGBH to complain that they showed such an <u>irresponsible</u>
 program and spent public funds on it. I enclose the letter I wrote to 
them. If humanity is to survive climate change, we must learn to use <u>much less </u>energy and we must help the world’s poorest mitigate the horrific impacts. </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Please act TODAY to stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. <u>That</u> is one small step <u>away</u>
 from fossil fuels. Use your power as President to move us quickly into a
 low-carbon future. It is the only way to sustain an hospitable CLIMATE 
on EARTH. And please stop PBS from spreading lies in the name of “fact.”
 <span>&nbsp;</span>Thank you. </span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Susan J. Ringler, Ashamed of PBS </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">Dear WGBH,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">I write to protest your broadcasting the “Humanity from Space” 2-hour special that I saw last evening 24 July 2015.<span>&nbsp; </span>This
 is not science. It is glossy manipulative propaganda with pretty 
pictures from space that sends the happy message that humans will 
innovate our way out of all problems, led by the largest corporations.<span>&nbsp; </span>Who funded this program? Who wrote and directed it? They should be ashamed of themselves. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">There is very little information on the Humanity from Space page of your <a href="http://www.pbs.org/program/humanity-from-space/">website</a>. You state the film is produced by <a href="http://www.dsp.tv/profile/">Darlow Smithson Productions</a>.
 Their website states they produce “factual documentaries” and does not 
even mention this program. They claim to “lead the field in factual 
television.”</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">The
 story-line of Humanity from Space is that small innovations have 
propelled civilization: the oil drill, the telegraph, and so on. About 
half the time is spent on coal, oil and cars and how they let cities 
expand. Civilization is conveyed with hundreds of photos and videos of 
busy highways, lit-up cities, a very US-centric view of civilization. 
The film also claims that the world is wonderfully connected, that 
Internet is everywhere and free, that people and goods travel everywhere
 freely, that commerce has allowed merchants to prosper (3 men on 3 
camels). The beautiful images from space almost never show Africa 
because it has so much less infrastructure.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">The second half mentions some problems facing humanity, and states that population, food, and water are the biggest ones.<span>&nbsp; </span>Climate change is mentioned in two sentences, as part of a general pollution problem, and social inequality is NEVER mentioned.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">Happy Talk Food:<span>&nbsp; </span>The
 solution to world hunger is technology to grow food more efficiently. 
We grow enough food NOW to feed people, but not in the right places, and
 at the right cost. People, profit, corruption and greed are keeping 
people from food. Technology won’t solve that. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">Happy Talk Energy: The film does say that we will need to turn to renewables for our energy, but uses the huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility">Ivanpah solar farm</a>
 as the best solution. No mention is made that Ivanpah produces only 
half the electricity they claimed, requires a steady supply of water 
(from faraway), and burns a lot more natural gas than expected. Did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRG_Energy">NRG</a> pay for this film?? They are a huge Texas energy company.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">The
 film never mentions how much energy we waste through transmission 
lines. The real solution for world energy is millions of small 
distributed solar systems, wind systems, and so on.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">And
 most chilling of all, this film shows none of the horrific impacts of 
climate disruptions, wars over water, millions of refugees, Rohinga, 
Syrian, who knows what.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">This
 film is propaganda for the largest agri-business, energy, and 
technology corporations. It has no business being shown as “science” or 
“documentary” on a publically-funded TV station. I am ashamed of PBS and
 WGBH.</span></p>

<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I
 haven’t written in a while because I am coming to doubt the power of 
grass roots movements to instigate change. But then, it is better to 
speak out than not to speak – as I wrote in letter #551. But it is so 
easy to be taken over by the “decay called silence.” So today I write to
 thank the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco for vacating 
the EPA rule that allowed Dow to sell SULFOXAFLOR, a dangerous 
neo-nicotinoid pesticide highly toxic to honeybees. </span></p>

<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">One win for the lowly honeybee who pollinates 25% of the food we eat!</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Please see to it that the EPA makes better decisions so we don’t need to involve the courts! And p</span><span style="font-family: arial;">lease
 stop the Keystone XL Pipeline RIGHT NOW! You really need to take a 
stronger stance for the climate. You will be judged – as will we all – 
by your/our actions – not words. Europe banned neo-nicotinoids at least a
 year ago. What took us so long? Would that all the appeals courts in 
the US be as focused on good stewardship as the Ninth Circuit is. I

 I really found your use of the phrase “We’ve got to walk the walk” as 
your closing message both ludicrous and disheartening. Walking the walk 
is matching <u>actions</u> to <u>words</u>. Speeches are only <u>words</u>
 and the actions the US is making to combat climate change are tiny 
wobbly baby steps compared to what Europe has achieved in the past 20 
years. It is disheartening to have you call these feeble actions 
“walking the walk:” 3 times the amount of wind power, 20 times as much 
solar power as 6 years ago! These are miniscule numbers that I am deeply
 embarrassed by. The United States is NOT a leader in combating climate 
Change. You are NOT doing <u>everything you can</u> to protect the planet from the global climate disaster. So p</span><span style="font-family: arial;">lease, stop talking and start WALKING.

stark conclusions will spark large-scale policy changes around the globe
 – but they can’t do it alone! They need your help. People count on <u>leaders</u> to act for the long-term good – to step back, reflect, and set an appropriate course. <u>You</u> are our LEADER.

Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The California snow pack is at its lowest level in 500 years. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/science/california-snow-report.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/science/california-snow-report.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">We know this from tree ring data 
from blue oaks. And researchers expect these “snow droughts” to become 
much more frequent because of global warming. We are lucky to have 500 
years of tree ring data to analyze. Scientists measuring arctic winter 
sea ice only have 40 years of data – </span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/science/coverage-of-arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-a-winter-low.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/science/coverage-of-arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-a-winter-low.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">no trees and tree rings to help them out! 500 years is a <u>long</u>
 time and we should use this alarming new data point to galvanize us 
into ACTION! We cannot afford to let 500-year and 1000-year weather 
events to become the NORM! Please please act decisively to curb carbon 
emissions. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline Right NOW to show you 
are really serious about saving California and the US economy. It’s OK 
to shrug off a few 50-year or 100-year events. But a 1000-year event!! 
It is sheer folly to ignore the future such an event warns us about. 
Please use your leadership to make people understand the enormity of the
 climate change problem. We are standing on the brink. You need to do 
more. Thank you.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">Cars
 are selling at about the same rate as last year. August sales numbers 
tell us that 17.8 million vehicles sold this year versus 17.3 million 
last year. </span></p>

<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">But
 the big news is that light trucks and SUVs are WAY more popular than 
cars. Car sales are down 10 % to 690,000 and truck/SUV sales are up 9% 
to 890,000. <u>Less than </u>HALF the passenger vehicles sold are now cars! SUVs and trucks are marketed heavily because they are more <u>profitable</u>
 for auto makers. We are told endlessly that they are convenient, 
comfortable and COOL! Nobody mentions that they get less gas mileage. 
Hey, the price of gas is down, so who cares? I care and you should care.
 Americans need to connect the dots between our driving habits and 
global warming! You need to insist on much tougher mileage standards 
much sooner. And we need a carbon tax! But if you can’t do <u>these</u> right away, you CAN </span><span style="font-family: arial;">stop
 the Keystone XL Pipeline! So DO IT NOW! No one is going to take you 
seriously in Paris – not unless you do something DRAMATIC. Thank you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In July Pres. Erdogan of Turkey 
finally agreed to let the US use the Incirlik air base for attacking 
ISIS, But they quickly started attacking Kurdish targets along the 
Syrian border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Erdogan is a fanatic who sees no 
difference between ISIS and the Kurds. His attempt to wipe out the Kurds
 along his border will ultimately lead to more chaos and destruction in 
the area. The US is <b>not</b> chastising Turkey for attacking Kurds. We
 will live to regret this, as many will see it as backing yet another 
extremist in the vain hope of quickly toppling a worse one!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/28/world/middleeast/turkey-and-us-agree-on-plan-to-clear-isis-from-strip-of-northern-syria.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/28/world/middleeast/turkey-and-us-agree-on-plan-to-clear-isis-from-strip-of-northern-syria.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Turning a blind eye to Turkish 
excessive force in exchange for using their air bases is both morally 
repugnant and strategically STUPID!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/opinion/americas-dangerous-bargain-with-turkey.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/opinion/americas-dangerous-bargain-with-turkey.html</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">So as we prolong the chaos in the Middle East, the planet continues to warm! Climate change waits for NO ONE! But you <b>can</b>
 slow down carbon emissions – start right NOW! Please stop the Keystone 
XL Pipeline today. It is a crucial first step. Thank you.</span></p>

</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I
 went to an art exhibit yesterday at a small local artist collective. 
One wall held 100 4” square sketches of people gazing at their cell 
phones. I send you 8 here, but imagine the impact of 100! The artist, 
Lydia Eccles, sees alienation, isolation, denial all around her and 
attributes this fragmentation to the stresses of living in our time of 
“impending <u>climate catastrophe</u>.” She may be right, but my response to her 100 images is to want to <u>do something</u> – no matter how small.. And so I write to you! And YOU can also <u>do something small</u> and that is to </span><span style="font-family: arial;">stop the Keystone XL Pipeline. Please do it NOW!. <span>&nbsp;</span>It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the climate crisis and ineffectual, but it feels better to do <u>something</u> rather than <u>nothing</u>!<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m
 sure you will agree. So thank you for what you DO and please DO a bit 
more. You can stop that pipeline. Just pick up your PEN. Thank you. </span></p>

</span><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">I
 was dismayed to read today about police use of a surveillance device 
called a “Stingray” that tracks people through their cell phones. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/us/stingray-covert-electronic-surveillance-prompts-calls-for-transparency.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/us/stingray-covert-electronic-surveillance-prompts-calls-for-transparency.html</a></span></p>
<p style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"><span style="font-family: arial; color: #222222;">The
 main reason we even KNOW this device EXISTS is due to thousands of 
hours of research by Daniel Rigmaiden who was caught for tax fraud by a 
Stingray and spent much of his 6 years in prison researching it. Thank 
you Mr. Rigmaiden for bringing it to public attention. Covert 
surveillance has no place in free societies and we must insist that such
 technology only be used with a warrant! We accuse the Chinese of 
suppressing dissent and spying on their citizens – but we do <u>some of the same</u>!
 I am ashamed that my government allows such actions. I am also ashamed 
of our meager progress on slowing climate change! Please act so I am 
less ashamed! Please stop the </span><span style="font-family: arial;">Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY. Thank you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I was so happy to read today that Shell is cancelling oil drilling in the arctic ocean! <span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/business/international/royal-dutch-shell-alaska-oil-exploration-halt.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/business/international/royal-dutch-shell-alaska-oil-exploration-halt.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><span>&nbsp;</span>HOORAY! Thanks to everyone who brought attention to what a bad idea it was! <b>You</b>
 could have helped out a bit more – so since you didn’t step up to that 
environmental challenge, please please help us out on TAR SANDS and STOP
 the Keystone XL Pipeline! Do it NOW! It’s the moral choice. Encourage 
Canada to leave that dirty oil IN THE GROUND!! Hilary Clinton finally 
spoke out opposing the Keystone XL Pipeline last week – another plea to 
KEEP IT IN THE GROUND!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/09/22/us/politics/22reuters-usa-election-clinton-keystone.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/09/22/us/politics/22reuters-usa-election-clinton-keystone.html?_r=0</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Things are looking up for us 
climate activists – so please join us and add your powerful voice to the
 most important fight of this century. If we want to leave a halfway 
healthy planet to our kids, we need to very quickly cut back on carbon 
pollution. Shell just lost $6 billion on its attempt to drill in the 
arctic ocean. Let’s start putting way more money and actions into 
Renewable energy. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Today I send you a letter I just 
wrote to the Police Chief in Carmel California asking him to make sure 
that his department DOES NOT call the recent vandalism of Junipero 
Serra’s statue a HATE CRIME. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">We need to be very careful to 
differentiate vandalism born of moral outrage from hatred of people for 
their beliefs, ethnicity, race, or gender. Although the vandals broke 
into the Carmel Mission, there is NO evidence of hatred of Catholics in 
their actions. Free speech is very important and sometimes climate 
activists resort to vandalism to draw attention to their words. This is 
NEVER based on hatred! So please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline <u>Right Now</u> so we can all work together to rapidly reduce our carbon emissions and improve <u>climate</u> and <u>social justice</u> throughout the world. Thank you.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear Police Chief,</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I read with regret yesterday that the statue of Junipero Serra at the Carmel Mission was defaced.<span>&nbsp; </span>But
 I write you to ask you NOT to call this a hate crime, not to let anyone
 in your department characterize it as such, and not to let the District
 Attorney prosecute anyone for a hate crime in connection with this 
incident.<span>&nbsp; </span>The NYTimes today reported “that the police continue to investigate what they have called a <b>hate crime</b>.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hate crimes are crimes against <b>large groups of people</b> for their beliefs, ethnicity, gender or such.<span>&nbsp; </span>This act of vandalism demonstrates no hatred of Catholics, only a<span>&nbsp; </span>repugnance for elevating Junipero Serra to sainthood.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
 action was undoubtedly taken to raise awareness of the details of his 
life and his awful treatment of native peoples. These details are not 
commonly taught in history in California schools. (I lived in the SF Bay
 Area for over 30 years where I raised 2 children who attended public 
schools). </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is 
important that we have laws against hate crimes. But it is also 
important that free speech not be inappropriately labeled. When a nun

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">There is another drought in Ethiopia this year.

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">So if Ethiopians arrive in Europe as part of this huge influx, remember that they too are REFUGEES, <u>climate</u>
 REFUGEES and not just simple migrants looking for work. Climate 
disruption changes everything! I remember the tragic 1984 Ethiopian 
famine, intensified by government breakdown. But that was considered a 
single tragic periodic event! Now we <b>know better</b>. Our climate is 
increasingly and dangerously disrupted. The answer is not closing 
borders! We must rapidly cut carbon pollution to try and slow this 
worldwide disaster down. Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline TODAY! 
Show your moral fibre. Show you understand the true costs of fossil

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I’ve been kind of busy. I’m moving next weekend into a condo I bought.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s
 right around the corner because I love this neighborhood and want to 
stay here a long time. Once I get settled I’m going to get a home energy
 audit and look into solar panels </span><span><a href="http://sunbugsolar.com/">http://sunbugsolar.com/</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">and everything I can do to reduce 
my energy use and my reliance on fossil fuels. People here are really 
cautious about spending money – that Yankee frugality – and if they 
can’t get their investment in renewable energy back in 4 or 5 years they
 tend to not switch. I’m not like that. I take the long view and the 
community view and I have the means to invest in the future – even if it
 is more than 5 years out! You have the means <b>too</b>. And you need 
to take the long view! Please stop the Keystone XL Pipeline today. 
Hilary Clinton has pledged to, and so has Bernie Sanders. You should do 
it now and grab the GLORY! It is the right thing to do and what the 
people want. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I take up my pen again, after a couple of months, to thank you for halting NEW coal leases on public land. </span><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/us/politics/in-climate-move-obama-to-halt-new-coal-mining-leases-on-public-lands.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/us/politics/in-climate-move-obama-to-halt-new-coal-mining-leases-on-public-lands.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This is a small but important step.
 Unfortunately, as we both know, 40 % of US coal mined is on PUBLIC 
LAND, much of it in the Powder River Basin. And this order does nothing 
to curtail those shameful misuses of public land. Please increase the 
lease fees for all fossil fuel extraction to at least $40 per ton of 
carbon released. Climate change is upon us and growing ever more 
dangerous. Please take bold moves <u>every day</u> to KIITG: Keep It In 
The Ground (fossil fuels of course). To be remembered and honored as the
 Environmental President, it is not sufficient to do more than 
predecessors. You must act based on the <u>Known Threat Level TODAY</u>. The climate change threat is HUGE. You need to step up and do <u>everything</u> you can. Do it for your kids and grand kids. It’s the only way. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I write to you today to honor 
Christiane Taubira who resigned this week as France’s Justice Minister 
because she opposed a bill to strip dual-national terrorists of their 
French citizenship. </span><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/world/europe/france-christiane-taubira-justice-minister-resigns.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/world/europe/france-christiane-taubira-justice-minister-resigns.html</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Ms. Taubira, born in French Guiana,
 bravely stands against two-tier systems that discriminate against more 
recently arrived immigrants. If you are French-born, you are not “more 
French.” As climate disruption grows more intense and competition for 
scant resources increases, we need MORE leaders like Ms. Taubira to 
guard against un-democratic racist policies. Climate justice issues loom
 ever larger as droughts and famines spread over vast areas. The best 
way to keep democracies healthy is to nip this climate problem in the 
bud! Please act again today to Keep Fossil Fuels in the Ground! KIITG!

installation recently in Miami about climate change and flooding. The 
performance elicits a strong emotional response from the viewers who 
watch people trying to perform ordinary tasks while water levels rise 
and fall <b>unpredictably</b>. We are struck by humans FRAILTY in the presence of water and flooding</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This performance focuses our 
attention on how ill-prepared we are for continuous unpredictable 
change. It is not something humans deal well with. As the climate 
disruption due to carbon pollution unfolds over the next few decades, we
 will face many dramatic weather events that we are unprepared for – and
 we too will <b>flail around helplessly</b>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our best
 defense is to reduce our carbon emissions very rapidly. Please do

<br>
It is appalling that the Porter Ranch methane leak continues unabated and out of control after 15 weeks. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/us/california-governor-declares-emergency-over-los-angeles-gas-leak.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/us/california-governor-declares-emergency-over-los-angeles-gas-leak.html</a></span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>It has spewed more than 2 million tons of methane into the atmosphere. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/us/california-state-enters-suit-over-long-running-gas-leak.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/us/california-state-enters-suit-over-long-running-gas-leak.html</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>Methane is at least 20 times more powerful a 
greenhouse gas as CO2. A sub-surface safety valve could have prevented 
this problem. It is unconscionable that every well in the country not be
 required to have these valves installed. It is fine to make stricter 
regulations for new drilling permits, but the safety of all of our wells
 needs to be greatly improved. </span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>It should be illegal to store natural gas 
without proper safety valves. The contribution of this single leak to 
our GHG emissions is huge. </span></p>

<p class="normal"><span><span>Dear President Obama,</span><br>
<br>
Recently Boston public transit – MBTA - has been holding public meetings
 on proposals to raise fares and end an 18 month old trial of late night
 T service on weekends. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span><a href="https://dailyfreepress.com/blog/2016/01/20/mbta-hosts-public-meetings-to-discuss-late-night-service/">https://dailyfreepress.com/blog/2016/01/20/mbta-hosts-public-meetings-to-discuss-late-night-service/</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>The governor has appointed a cost-cutting 
committee (FMCB) and they have already made up their minds! So much for 
public input! The MBTA says late night service is too expensive but 
won’t admit that Sunday morning has even fewer riders and so is MORE 
expensive! They didn’t advertise the public meetings well and don’t seem
 to care that restaurant workers and others who work odd hours USE IT! I
 was so annoyed I started a change.org petition to save late night 
service- but its a struggle getting attention. </span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>Public transit, longer hours, more routes, more 
frequent buses are all CRUCIAL to combatting climate change! And they 
are CRUCIAL for economic justice! Please speak out every ay linking

Letter #573</span><span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>
<p class="normal"><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>The big news this week was not that Trump and 
Sanders won in the New Hampshire primary, but that the Supreme Court 
blocked implementation of the EPA rule regulating coal-fired plants. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/us/politics/supreme-court-blocks-obama-epa-coal-emissions-regulations.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/us/politics/supreme-court-blocks-obama-epa-coal-emissions-regulations.html</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>How dare they? It was a political statement with
 little practical consequence, as the rule wends through lower courts. 
Clearly the separation of powers is not very separate these days. So it 
is <u>even more</u> important for you to act as forcefully as you can to
 KIITG! Keep fossil fuels in the ground. The eyes of the world are on us
 after the Paris Climate Agreement and it is up to <b>you</b> to 
reassure world leaders that the US is serious about attacking climate 
change. The courts should stick to law - but when they don’t, it is all 
the more important that the rest of us <b>act</b> to combat climate change.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span><span>Dear President Obama,</span><br>
<br>
I write today about the outsize power and money of the Westlands Water 
Districts in CA that allows them to grab water cheaply to the detriment 
of everyone. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/us/farmers-try-political-force-to-twist-open-californias-taps.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/us/farmers-try-political-force-to-twist-open-californias-taps.html</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>Water is a precious commodity that sustains life
 and groundwater should be public good- shared by all. I also write to 
honor Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant who doggedly 
opposes the Westland water and power grab. Climate change is making 
water more important as we stumble through droughts and flooding in ever
 more ominous cycles. Our water laws are woefully outdated and allow 
large landowners to drill wells as deep as money can buy, sucking the 
groundwater from poorer neighbors. Please find a way to limit greedy 
farmers from grabbing all the water for high-profit <b>export</b> crops 
like almonds! The price of water for export crops should be double what 
it is for domestic crops! That would change what crops are grown for the
 better. Water is essential to life - we cannot let greed dominate its 
use. Thank you.</span></p>

temperature swings in a few days! And remember the awful floods along 
the Mississippi in December!? </span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>It never floods in December because its <b>Frozen</b>! But not this year. We can only hope that the plant and animal communities we <u>depend</u>
 on are able to adapt to these unprecedented conditions. And remember 
even when we stop carbon pollution, the planet will continue to warm for
 decades - a truly alarming prospect! So I write to you again to urge 
you to do <u>all you can </u>to keep fossil fuels in the ground! KIITG! 
This is our only option and we need to move as rapidly as possible to 
renewable energy sources and sustainable agriculture practices. Please 
do all you can - everyday!</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>(especially letter by Victor Goode). France and Britain <u>are friends</u>:
 democracies with similar economic and legal systems. Saudi Arabia is a 
long-term trading partner (oil for weapons) whose autocratic rulers 
provided regional calm for decades, causing us to turn a blind eye to 
radical Wahhabi fundamentalists, human rights being trampled; attacks on
 the Houthi minority. Saudi Arabia is the kind of ally NO ONE NEEDS!:<span>&nbsp; </span>not dependable, self-interested, talking nice to us to get more weapons. So <b>stop</b>
 listening to the arms merchants who claim selling weapons to Saudi 
Arabia will calm the Middle East and be good for the US! The US has a 
long history of choosing “friends” badly - so let’s ratchet down our 
friendship with Saudi Arabia- and <u>our trade</u>! The Middle East will
 be no more violent than it is NOW! Renewable energy technology and 
battery technology - that’s what we should be exporting! The wrong steps
 now and climate change will <u>ruin</u> <b><u>all</u></b> of our lives.

<p class="normal"><span><span>Dear President Obama,</span><br>
<br>
Turkey is another ally we should distance ourselves from. The last few 
months have been particularly bad. The US wanted access to a Turkish 
airbase to “help” control ISIS, and in return Turkey said it had to 
secure its borders and started massive shellings of KURDS. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/world/europe/turkey-kurds-pkk.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/world/europe/turkey-kurds-pkk.html</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>Turkey’s president Erdogan hates all Kurds and 
concentrates more on wiping them out than ISIS. He does much to 
destabilize the region and prolong the Syrian war.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>Now Syrian kurds are trying to carve out a Kurdish region and we should applaud them. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/world/middleeast/syria-kurds.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/world/middleeast/syria-kurds.html</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>Kurds by their actions have proven to be honest,
 honorable, effective managers of oil assets, liberal, secular, more 
democratic, and less sexist than their neighbors. We should support 
them, <b>NOT</b> Erdogan. And now that Turkey is the gatekeeper for Syrian refugees trying to escape to Europe, what chance does a <b>Syrian Kurd</b> have of getting to Europe?! None. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/world/europe/turkey-european-union-refugees.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/world/europe/turkey-european-union-refugees.html</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>All will be labeled terrorists: men, women and

we learn nothing from the Armenian genocide? Don’t kid yourself on who

<p class="normal"><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>

 from poor people with these predatory contracts where they can be 
evicted for tiny matters and stand little chance of ever owning the

 and such insatiable <b>greed</b>. Greed will bring down much that is 
good in human achievement if we let it. Greed and the lure of short-term
 profit is also severely hampering our ability to slow carbon emissions 
and climate change. I know that racism poisons the daily lives of 
millions of people and honor you for all you do to combat it. But 
tolerance will only thrive in a climate that flourishes. Remember, the 
planet will continue to warm for 20 years <b>after</b> we stop burning fossil fuels! Please stop drilling leases on <b>all</b>
 federal lands right NOW. It will do much to lessen RACISM! Please think

<p class="normal"><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>Government-paid public defenders are the 
backbone of “liberty and justice for all.” Yet we spend LESS in our 
states and counties on public defense now than 20 years ago, while the 
number of felony cases has risen by 40%. This is a mockery of justice 
for the poor as Prof. John Pfaff so clearly details! <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/opinion/a-mockery-of-justice-for-the-poor.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/opinion/a-mockery-of-justice-for-the-poor.html</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>I applaud his suggestion for a $4 billion grant 
to local governments to improve access to public defenders. But, as 
yesterday, I also repeat that tolerance can only thrive in a <b>climate</b> that flourishes! Leadership is really about long term goals and vision that sees <b>way</b> <b>beyond</b>
 today and tomorrow. Money for public defenders is important, but money 
to stave off the worst of climate change is even more important. Please 
use your leadership and influence to KIITG! Keep it in the ground! Stop 
federal drilling leases, off-shore and on. It won’t win you a popularity
 contest this month, but it is the only hope for your children and 
grandchildren - and justice for those generations - after we are gone.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>To the fracking industry, the fertile soil they 
need to scrape off to mine the sand is OVERBURDEN. What a word. That

 system is truly messed up when such richness holds little economic 
value. Not only do we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground KITTG! But
 we also need to damage the fertile land still remaining far LESS. 
Climate change is creating <b>less</b> arable land, and we allow “cheap 
land prices” to destroy great arable land? We really ARE stupid. Please 
do everything you can do reduce carbon emissions and slow down climate 
change. We are not handing off a healthy planet to our children. A farm

<p class="normal"><span><span>Dear President Obama,</span><br>
<br>
I went to a Cambridge City hearing yesterday to advocate for Columbus 
Day to be changed to Indigenous People’s Day. Boy - we should have done 
that a <u>long</u> time ago. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span><a href="http://www.cambridgeday.com/2016/06/07/indigenous-peoples-day-voted-in-by-council-as-cleansing-columbus-day-replacement/">http://www.cambridgeday.com/2016/06/07/indigenous-peoples-day-voted-in-by-council-as-cleansing-columbus-day-replacement/</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>A group of local 8th graders were perhaps the 
most compelling speakers. Columbus was an awful man. I spoke briefly in 
favor of the change and told the city councilors and citizens that 
indigenous peoples all over the world are far better stewards of the 
earth than white Europeans like me. If indigenous peoples had control of
 80% of the earth, we would be facing far less <u>climate change</u>. We
 really need to connect the social justice movement and the climate 
movement. I wish I could do more to show people that all of these 
important struggles will be pointless if we mess the climate up so much 
that large swaths of humanity DIE. So please do everything you can to 
KIITG. Keep it in the ground! And please show people the connections 
between keeping the planet livable and social justice for all. Thank 
you.</span></p>

I write to you today to honor the cake-guy Ant Smith from north Florida. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/dining/art-smith-chef-florida-disney.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/dining/art-smith-chef-florida-disney.html</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>My daughter just graduated from college and that meant celebrations and cake-making<span>&nbsp; </span>and
 eating - which reminded me to write to you about him. He wants to 
revitalize a corner of northern Florida by teaching locals how to bake 
those gorgeous southern cakes, starting a cake factory - and selling 
them to restaurants at Walt Disney World. I love the synergy of his 
plan: Excellent local products sold to people on vacation near-by. 
Locals call him “a force of nature” and I hope his energy is catching!! 
This is a much better way to rebuild a local economy than huge 
extractive industries like fossil fuels. Please help entrepreneurs like 
Art Smith - and show the link between his vision and ours of KIITG! Keep
 it in the ground!! We need to rebuild corners of America with 
sustainable jobs of <b>all</b> kinds! So let them Eat Cake and let’s cut down carbon emissions! Thank you.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>Dear President Obama,</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>It’s raining and I am glad - we had a very dry 
month - only half the usual rainfall - each time they say it’s going to 
rain, just a few drops fall, until last night. We’ve gotten about an 
inch - good for the garden, the birds, the ecosystem. But it’s not 
actually my garden that matters, it’s the relentless increase in carbon 
pollution that we are doing <b>so little</b> about. In the New Yorker 
recently, Adam Gopnik praised your slow steady push for liberal change, 
likening it to trying to turn an ocean liner. </span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>But what if we don’t have time? What is we’ve 
waited too long? I feel an urgency to pick up the pace of change and 
urge you to join us - to push harder, speak louder, act boldly to help 
KIITG! Keep it in the ground. It is the only way for decent lives for 
our grand children. It just doesn’t feel like slow and steady is enough 
these days. Please, please use your voice, your influence.</span></p>

<p class="normal"><span>I’ve been meaning to write to you about Isle de Jean Charles, LA where 90% of the land mass has washed into the Gulf of Mexico. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/resettling-the-first-american-climate-refugees.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/resettling-the-first-american-climate-refugees.html</a></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span>The recent National Climate Assessment Report 
highlighted this place - home to about 60 indigenous people. $48 million
 has been set aside to move this entire community, or at least those 
that want to move. It’s supposed to be a test case for how to deal with 
climate change - and the money has to be spent by 2022 - but that just 
means consultants and land owners and who knows who will try to get a 
piece of that money - and earnest gov’t employees are going door to door
 trying to find out what residents want. Good education and health care 
and in short supply - so yet another generation will grow up without 
social and economic justice. If you could provide some speed boats and 
tutors, maybe the kids could do better in school - and learn about 
climate disruption and make choices for their lives. Maybe this test 
case should weight <u>their</u> voices ten times greater than their 
elders! As it is, we’re not going to learn much from the study, and 
those kids lives are already disrupted by climate chaos. If you do <u>everything</u> you can to KIITG! those kids will have a better chance. Thank you.</span></p>

<span>Dear President Obama,</span>

<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">Yesterday GreenCambridge gave a 
sustainability award to the retiring City Manager and several department
 heads. Cambridge adopted a plan on how to GET TO net-zero carbon new 
buildings – much of which does not go into effect for 20 years. It was a
 long drawn-out compromise, better than nothing. The various recipients 
sad it was a difficult process and that it was the best that could be 
done, and now they go around telling other cities how to do the same. As
 an activist it just makes me tired – all the meetings I attended, all 
the public comment I gave, and we congratulate these city employees for 
their excellence and high achievement. If this is the fastest that we 
can possibly be moving, we are all doomed to pay <u>enormous</u> costs, 
for our failure to cut carbon emissions sooner. So I tell them, and I 
tell you: DO MORE!! In your remaining months end ALL new oil/gas permits
 on public land and at sea! This is really important – more than 
anything else. We must KIITG ! Keep it in the ground. Use your remaining
 power to do <u>everything</u> you can. Thank you.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">2.2 BILLION cubic feet of toxic waste 
poured into the Doce River and spewed 400 miles downstream to the 
Atlantic Ocean – 16 days later. There’s no update because nothing has 
been done!</span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">No clean up, no regulations so other 
such dams don’t burst. No study of ecosystem destruction, public health 
problems, no compensation for fishermen. Brazil is falling apart, and 
when that happens, protecting the environment falls ever lower on the 
agenda. This was an iron ore mine disaster, not fossil fuels, but the 
scale of environmental damage going unpunished is <u>mind boggling</u>. 
It’s way past time for extractive industries to PAY for the true cost of
 environmentaol damage they have caused. Let’s put a price on carbon and
 other pollution – let’s speed up our protections for air and water 
while we still have time to avert the WORST of cliomate change. Your job
 is really to do what’s best for the people – ALL the people – that’s 
protecting the CLIMATE! So please get busy – do EVEN MORE! Thank you.</span>

<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">I write today about the Zika virus and all the fear-generating stories in the media.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/health/zika-virus-pregnancy-delay-birth-defects-cdc.html?searchResultPosition=1">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/health/zika-virus-pregnancy-delay-birth-defects-cdc.html?searchResultPosition=1</a></span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">As the media have become more 
controlled by entertainment companies and ad-driven revenue, the CDC 
needs to make sure the public gets the FACTS. The most important 
statement about Zika recently was hidden in column 4 of a NYTimes 
article: If women delay pregnancy for one season, and lots of people get
 Zika, the virus is likely to disappear! So I say to my daughter – keep 
using birth-control and get a few mosquito bites! Problem solved. 
Getting Zika when you are NOT pregnant gives you antibodies for when you
 are! Instead of diverting money from Ebola research to Zika research, 
we should be spending WAY more on slowing climate change! The biggest 
threat to women’s health and children’s health is climate change! Not 
Zika. Brazil has 1500 cases of microencephaly so far this year – for 1.5
 M births, so 1 per thousand, that’s pretty small – and as Zika 
antibodies spread widely through the population, microencephaly will 
plummet. Much more important for everyone is cutting carbon pollution! 
We desperately need to KIITG ! Keep it in the ground. Please do 
everything you can! Thank you.</span>

<span style="font-family: arial;">The document that had been taught to 
me as a model of human rights, inalienable rights to life, liberty and

countless newspaper accounts of the British “using” slaves and native 
Americans against “Americans.”<span>&nbsp;</span> Oh my, how sad – and 
how cowardly of us to allow children to be taught the happy happy story.
 We have racism in our past and our present and need to acknowledge it. 
One of the best ways I can think of to remedy our ingrained racial fear

Keep Fossil Fuels in the Ground! Climate change is already HERE and

<span style="font-family: arial;">The whole purpose of federal 
government is to provide checks on crazy local behavior. You failed 
miserably! Carbon capture will NEVER be cost effective. Stop wasting 
money on CCS: my tax money. Make Southern Co. pay the tuition hike at 
the Univ. of Southern Mississippi – not the students! Better education 
for Miss. Residents would get them to push back against unfair utility 
rate hikes like we are doing in Massachusetts! (Not on my bill,<span>&nbsp;</span> Charlie!) So forget “clean coal” It’s a lie! And please</span> <span style="font-family: arial;">KIITG ! Keep It in the Ground. Thank you.</span>

<span style="font-family: arial;">I write to you today to honor 
journalists who have been assassinated because they bring us the news. 
They were all part of a citizen journalist group “Ragga is Being 
Slaughtered Silently,” and for that they were targeted by ISIS.</span>

 an unfortunate result of my writing less frequently. This image soothes
 me. I love the interplay of curly bumpy nature and the huge round 
barrel, the straight lines of the staves and rice paddies against the 
curves of the barrel, the simple tools, the diligent man all give a 
calming sense of an orderly world. We need images like this precisely <u>because</u>
 our world is becoming MORE chaotic as the climate warms and we face 
more and more frequent climate disruptions. The huge fire near Tar Sands
 in Alberta Canada that wiped out a town, and then just moved on across 
the boreal forest.</span>

<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">The skies all across the US are vastly
 brighter now than 40 years ago – and although this is clearly less 
important than climate change, I think our human predilection for stuff 
and showing off, lighting up our buildings needlessly – encourages us to
 think we can “tame” nature, instead of living in synergy and harmony 
with it. When I was growing up in Chicago, even city kids knew the Big 
Dipper and now you can scarcely make it out. Darker skies help us 
remember we are small and remind us to be grateful to be part of a 
wonderful and complex natural world. They remind us that we don’t want 
to mess up the climate and imbalance the complex web of life that let’s 
us flourish. So I wrote some haiku. Here is one:</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-family: arial;">Lights loom, pollute urban sky.</span>

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">Light pollution, carbon pollution. 
They are connected, they are caused by our callous lack of concern, our 
hubris. Please work harder to</span> <span style="font-family: arial;">KIITG ! Keep It in the Ground. It is the most important work you can do. Thank you.</span>

<span>Dear President Obama,</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">Well here we are: 600 letters in about
 1200 days! I hope you have found some of them entertaining and others 
thought-provoking. But most of all I hope they have spurred you to ever 
more <u>effort</u> to cut carbon emissions QUICKLY so that we don’t ruin
 the planet for future generations. Yesterday I marched with a few 
hundred others to tell our state government to stop building pipelines 
we don’t need. We called it People over Pipelines – a 4 day march that I
 also took part in on Thursday.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: arial;">I’m hopeful that we got some attention
 and nudged our politicians along, but I am sad that the fossil fuel 
industry is so powerful, even in a Democratic state – that we had to 
march at all! So please please <u>Put People over Pipelines</u>, protect
 our climate for future generations. There is no more important work 
that you can do. Stop all new drilling leases on land and sea. to</span> <span style="font-family: arial;">KIITG ! Keep It in the Ground.<span>&nbsp;</span> You’ll be happy to know that we had speakers from <u>Black Lives Matter</u>
 and prison reform groups at our rallies. We know that the most 
vulnerable get hurt first. I’m also happy to report there were tons of 
young people. They are fighting for THEIR WORLD, their tomorrow. Please 
join us. Thank you.</span>
